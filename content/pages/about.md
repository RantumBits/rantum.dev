Web developer and agency owner at [ecomloop](https://ecomloop.com).

I enjoy using technology to make everyday lives incrementally better.

Nantucket-native. Boston College alum. San Francisco Bay Area since 2004.

Being a father of two boys teaches me more about myself than any outside influence.

Strongly believe in developing agency, acting upon curiosity, approaching ideas with open-mindedness, accepting responsibility and striving for continual self-development.

Most meaningful events occurred long ago and lessons learned should be adapted to new situations.

Incremental progress leads to transformational change. Transformational change defines the future.
