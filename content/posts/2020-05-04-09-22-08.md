My time on the SoSH forums in my college and post college years taught me a lot about stats. One of the concepts I think about often is VORP or value above replacement player. A power hitting SS is more valuable than a power hitting 3B (assuming comparable defensive skills) because it's generally harder to find a good hitting SS.

Similarly, we can all work to develop skills that increase our value over the replacement. Find ways to push specialized skills (SS defense) while maintaining high output general skills (power hitting).
