When the world changes drastically, the mind can become decluttered easily. There's a lot to process and there are many changes, some readily apparently and others in the subconcious.

Declutter the mind by addressing the biggest anxieties. Find the items causing problems and address them head on. Make plans for short and long term solutions.
