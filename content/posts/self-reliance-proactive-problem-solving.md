Self-reliance doesn't necessarily mean doing everything on your own. It's infeasible to be an expert in everything and making that a requirement will impose limits.

Instead, use self-reliance to take a proactive approach to problem solving. Understand the problem as best as possible to gain understanding, then articulate what is needed next from an expert in the area.
