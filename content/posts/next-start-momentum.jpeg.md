In baseball, there's a saying that momentum is only as good as the next game's staring pitcher. Regardless of how many runs are scored today, there will be another game and it will start at zero.

Prepare for the _next start_ and recognize there will be always be more. Be ready to start strong, rather than eking nominal returns out of the end of the previous day.
