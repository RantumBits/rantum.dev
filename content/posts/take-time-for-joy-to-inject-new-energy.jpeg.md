Finding joy takes work sometimes. That's not a reason not to do it. Use joy + relaxation to inject energy into projects.

Generate new ideas by feeling more upbeat and optimistic. It is work to have fun sometimes. Keep finding a way regardless of the situation. Look for what is, rather than what is not.
