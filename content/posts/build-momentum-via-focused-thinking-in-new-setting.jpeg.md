When feeling stuck or unmotivated, change the setting and dedicate ten minutes of focused thinking. Build momentum via focused thinking in new setting.

This will help spur ideas, generate momentum, and change overall outlook on the task & project at hand.

Ideally, it should be something with few distractions. Consider a quick walk, bike ride, or stretching. Then come back and try it again.
