When the next big change is beyond control, a feeling of being unanchored can develop.

Kurt Vonnegut describes Billy Pilgrim of being unstuck from time in Slaugterhouse Five and there's a similar feeling from the pandemic conditions that leave us looking for what's next.

Calendars are somewhat meaningless for significant change as no dates can be pinpointed. Look beyond a calendar for progress.
