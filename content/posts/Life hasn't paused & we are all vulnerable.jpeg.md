Life hasn't paused & we are all vulnerable. Another friend passed away too early this weekend.

A young dad, two kids, and no obvious reason. He was always upbeat, friendly & energetic. Most recently, we met at Moffett Fields to watch a mutual friend land an F-18 in prep for a flyover at a 49ers game in November. He was on his own and I was there with my wife and kids - and we were all like kids around the two jets as we got a personal tour around them. He will be missed.

This is the third male friend who died in the last 9 months in situations where it seemed entirely plausible that it could be me.
