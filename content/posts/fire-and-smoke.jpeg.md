The state is on fire, with some reports estimating enough acreage to cover the state of Connecticut. On the drive from Tahoe to the Bay Area, there's nothing but smoke. Multiple areas along 80 show the remnants of fire destruction, leaving nearly unimaginable thoughts of how big the fires must be to jump entire freeways.

It's devastating to see and unlikely to change. The drought cycles continue, people keep spreading to rural areas, and the kindling is set for fires to spread.

Fire and smoke dominates the days.
