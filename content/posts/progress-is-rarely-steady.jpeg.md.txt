It's inevitable that projects will hit setbacks. It's even more true for projects that involve creating *new* solutions, as compared to those with well-tested plans.

My dad often quoted a line from [Robert Burn's poem, 'To a Mouse'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse):

> The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry

Progress is rarely a straight line. Overcome the setbacks.
