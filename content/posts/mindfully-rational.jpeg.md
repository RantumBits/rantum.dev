Everyone is consumed by more than what's on the surface. Every interaction in influenced by any number of unknown past experiences.

This year, every person has experienced drastic change. Take time to process changes and recognize many cannot or will not do the same. Show patience with others. Find time to reflect & meditate, then bring mindfulness throughout the day.
