Mornings shouldn't be left up to others to dictate. Put effort into dictating what gets attention in the mornings by not relying on newsfeeds. If you look for news, it will always be there. It's rare that the news should change anything personally in the short term.

Focus attention in the mornings and let the news wait for later in the day.
