Do not let fear of irrelevance prevent publishing projects. It's a natural fear and it shouldn't be ignored. Address the issues by building something for the audience you already have, then share the project with them becuase it was built for them. If it's still irrelevant, it's best to rework or scrap the project before investing more time.
