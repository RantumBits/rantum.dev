description: When forced to rebuild work, take time to improve the next time around. Strengthen the weaknesses that lead to the problems first, and look for additional opportunities next. Use the insight gained to build with new ideas in mind. It's a frustrating process and there's no point in doing it again if it will lead to further problems.
