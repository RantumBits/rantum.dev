End of day routines can be just as beneficial as morning routines. Use it as a time to appreciate the good, anticipate what's next, and make plans to improve the problems. Don't waste the time introducing problems that cannot be solved that day. It it's a worthwhile problem, there will be a better chance to fix it tomorrow.
