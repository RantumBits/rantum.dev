  :books: :ski: :bike: :tennis: :baseball: :mountain: :pencil: 


  Web developer and agency owner at [ecomloop](ecomloop.com).  I enjoy using
  technology to make everyday lives incrementally better. 


  Nantucket-native. Boston College alum. San Francisco Bay Area since 2004.


  Being a father of two boys teaches me more about myself than any outside
  influence.


  Strongly believe in developing agency, acting upon curiosity, approaching
  ideas with open-mindedness, accepting responsibility and striving for
  continual self-development.


  Most meaningful events occurred long ago and lessons learned should be adapted
  to new situations.


  Incremental progress leads to transformational change. Transformational change
  defines the future.
