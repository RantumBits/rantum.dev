19 years ago smoke poured out of the tired. As the country witnessed thousands died, a feeling of vulnerability developed. The response was delved in the strength of unity, and the country and NYC triumphed again.

Today, smoke pours from forests across the west. Millions are displaced from homes due to climate change. Thousands dies on a weekly basis because of a poor health response to coronavirus.

There's too many similarities and there's a sense of normalcy to the current problems. What's entirely missing is a united effort to defeat these challenges. Like 9/11, this is a time to work for the betterment of entire communities, not individuals.
