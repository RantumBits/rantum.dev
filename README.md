Web developer and agency owner at ecomloop. I enjoy using technology to make everyday lives incrementally better.

Nantucket-native. Boston College alum. San Francisco Bay Area since 2004.

Being a father of two boys has taught me more about myself than any outside influence.

Strongly believe in developing agency, acting upon curiosity, approaching ideas with open-mindedness, accepting responsibility and striving for continual self-development.

Most meaningful events occurred long ago and lessons learned should be adapted to new situations.

Incremental progress leads to transformational change. Transformational change defines the future.
