A vote against this measure will remove zoning restrictions that have restricted developers voters over the past 30 years.]]></description><link>https://rantum.dev/posts/no-measure-y-san-mateo-2020</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://rantum.dev/posts/no-measure-y-san-mateo-2020</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:04:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Measure Y is a proposal to restrict building in San Mateo by imposing strict limits for another 10 years. A vote against this measure will remove zoning restrictions that have restricted developers voters over the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the restrictions placed by Measure Y would allows developers to build more homes and help alleviate the housing affordability issues facing the entire Bay Area. By allowing higher density housing, local businesses would have more potential customers, the city tax base will increase, and more local community members likes teachers, nurses and firefighters will have the opportunity to live in San Mateo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noonmeasurey.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;devoted to the No on Y cause&lt;/a&gt;, with “major funding” by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Advocacy, with more information. Mayor Joe Goethals has voiced his opposition to Measure Y, as have a number of local San Mateo government and business leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measure Y limits how many homes can be built on a piece of land. These limits are particularly detrimental to special needs, or supportive affordable housing. For special needs housing to be financially possible, it must almost always be over 100 units per acre, even if it is only two stories. This is because supportive affordable housing requires resource-intensive on-site services. Non-profit builders cannot sustain these costs if the housing doesn’t serve enough people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site linked above has more info, as well as posters available for pickup. There wasn’t a download link immediately apparent so I created a couple versions for downloading and printing. One focuses on removing building restrictions, while the other focuses on building affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s even more true for projects that involve creating &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; solutions, as compared to those with well-tested plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad often quoted a line from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Robert Burn’s poem, ‘To a Mouse’&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress is rarely a straight line. Overcome the setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Purple cow is a marketing concept developed by marketer and entrepreneur Seth Godin that states that companies must build things worth noticing right into their products or services.
“as consumers, we’re too busy to pay attention to advertising, but we’re desperate to find good stuff that solves our problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

Develop a literal list of virtues major decisions, and influence everyday actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, virtues are ideals agreed upon by most of society as being positive. These differ from values, which vary greatly for each individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Franklin strived to improve upon a set of 13 virtues. He focused upon one each week, working to improve that particular virtue. Meanwhile, he kept a running checklist of all virtues and marked his transgressions each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin’s list of virtues used terms that seemed somewhat outdated. His principle of striving for continual improvement is not. This virtues list [serves as a great start(&lt;a href=&quot;https://liveanddare.com/virtues/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://liveanddare.com/virtues/&lt;/a&gt;), and I used it as a guide to create an 8 item list of virtues. I put this list in my daily notebook, which I carry nearly everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;courage&lt;/strong&gt; ability to do the right thing in the face of fear. For a few, it is the absence of fear; for most, it’s the willingness to act despite fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diligence&lt;/strong&gt; commitment and dedication. It is about making a decision once, and hen keeping it up despite adversities and mood fluctuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;humility&lt;/strong&gt; don’t compare self to others. let go of the desire to feel superior by means of wealth, fame, intelligence, beauty, titles, or influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equanimity&lt;/strong&gt; the ability to accept the present moment without emotional reaction, without agitation - especially in times of turbulence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;detachment&lt;/strong&gt; forgiveness, flexibility. separate outcomes from controllable actions. let go and see what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;joy&lt;/strong&gt; cheerful, content, happy, and grateful. There is always something good in anything that happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; feeling that if you keep true to your path, things will eventually become. there is something good to come out of the next part of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kindness&lt;/strong&gt; expand personal sense of well-being to include others. ability to put ourselves in another person’s shoes, and feel what they feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisdom has been left off this list and should be mentioned. It’s best to act with wisdom but it’s hard to strive for wisdom. Wisdom develops out of other virtues, rather than as a leading ideal to be sought.&lt;/p&gt;

A power hitting SS is more valuable than a power hitting 3B (assuming comparable defensive skills) because it’s generally harder to find a good hitting SS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can all work to develop skills that increase our value over the replacement. Find ways to push specialized skills (SS defense) while maintaining high output general skills (power hitting).

I enjoy using technology to make everyday lives incrementally better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nantucket-native. Boston College alum. San Francisco Bay Area since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a father of two boys has taught me more about myself than any outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strongly believe in developing agency, acting upon curiosity, approaching ideas with open-mindedness, accepting responsibility and striving for continual self-development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most meaningful events occurred long ago and lessons learned should be adapted to new situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incremental progress leads to transformational change. Transformational change defines the future.&lt;/p&gt;
