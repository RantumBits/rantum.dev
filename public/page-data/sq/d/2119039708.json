This year has been a fruitful year.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nLepore,&#160;a physician and surgeon at Nantucket&#160;Cottage&#160;Hospital and one of the&#160;nation's&#160;foremost tick-borne-disease expects, said he doesn&#8217;t consider this year&#8217;s numbers an aberration yet. The number of positive Lyme disease cases vary from year to year, but if he were to see 200 or more cases by the end of the year, it would be reason for concern, he added.&#160;\n\r\nA number of factors could be contributing to the rise in cases this year, said Elizabeth Harris, Nantucket Cottage Hospital&#8217;s infection prevention manager. The increased numbers of people spending time outdoors, and the larger footprint that deer have had &#160;around the island this spring are the two primary reasons, she believes.&#160;\n\r\n&#8220;When all of this (COVID-19) stuff started happening, everything was pretty much shut down on the island,\" Harris said.&#160;&#8220;When I would go to work in the morning, I would see no cars, but would see deer walking around like they owned the road. There were deer everywhere.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nThere was also increased public use of the island&#8217;s open spaces, as people walked and biked when much of the downtown area was shut down and stay-at-home advisories were in effect. The trend continued in the summer with&#160;an abundance of sunny days, she said.&#160;\n\r\nDeer are&#160;essential in the life cycle of the blacklegged tick (also known as the deer tick) that carries Lyme disease. Although the ticks&#160; feed on smaller mammals&#160;like rodents, in order&#160;to obtain the protein necessary for laying&#160;eggs, they must find a more substantial &#8220;blood meal,&#8221; and in the majority of cases, deer&#160;are the perfect host.&#160;Wherever you see deer on-island, there is a good chance ticks will be there as well.\n\r\n&#8220;The ticks need deer blood to successfully&#160;reproduce,&#8221; Lepore said.&#160;&#8220;If you kill off the deer, you would see a&#160;fall-off&#160;in the tick-borne diseases.&#8221;&#160;&#160;\n\r\nAccording to the Nantucket Historical Association, deer&#160;were imported to Nantucket&#160;in the 1920s,&#160;and without any natural predators on the island, their numbers grew exponentially.\n\r\n&#8220;There are no bears, no cougars, no coyotes, all they have to do is watch out for the Range Rovers,&#8221; Lepore said.&#160;&#8220;If they look both ways before they cross the street, and move into (no trespassing areas) during hunting season, they&#8217;ll live a good long time.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nKey symptoms of Lyme disease, a bacterial infection that can spread to the joints, heart and nervous system,&#160;are similar to the common cold and include fever, chills,&#160;muscle aches, headache and&#160;fatigue.&#160;The symptoms are&#160;also&#160;similar&#160;to those of coronavirus, but Harris doesn&#8217;t think that has led to increased testing, and as a result an increase in positive results.&#160;\n\r\n&#8220;On one hand people are&#160;extremely&#160;worked up about COVID and interested in testing, but at the same&#160;time&#160;people don&#8217;t really want to come to the hospital unless they absolutely have to,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#8220;So,&#160;I think it kind of balances out. I think it really comes down to people being out&#160;in&#160;nature&#160;more.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nHarris said she has found a common theme among those tested for Lyme disease this year. Not very many are checking themselves for ticks after being outdoors.&#160;For maximum protection, the hospital recommendation is to wear light-colored, full-length clothing and tuck your pants into your socks. But&#160;during the hot summer months, that was something few were willing to do.&#160;\n\r\n&#8220;It might be the ultimate dorky look but it&#8217;s better than getting Lyme disease,&#8221; Lepore said.&#160;\n\r\nHarris recommends&#160;thoroughly&#160;checking for ticks&#160;after being outdoors. That means checking everywhere,&#160;especially in spots you might not think to look, like&#160;behind the&#160;knees, under the armpits&#160;and on the head. If people just took that simple precaution after being outdoors, it would&#160;eliminate a lot of potential cases, Harris said.&#160;\n\r\nTick season on Nantucket runs from&#160;spring into&#160;the fall&#160;and the peak is during the summer months, when people are most often outdoors.&#160;But because there is a delay of a few weeks from a&#160;tick bite&#160;to when symptoms of a&#160;tick-borne illness&#160;appear, Harris said many of the cases come in during the early fall.&#160;\n\r\nAnaplasmosis, another tick-borne illness, is also trending up this year, with 15 total cases after only two cases reported to the state last year, Harris said. But babesiosis is in line with case numbers from last year: 26 by mid-August, compared to 41 all of last year. But many of the cases of babesiosis show up later in the fall, so Harris said the island is still on pace to match or surpass&#160;last year&#8217;s totals.&#160;\n\r\nThe tick population isn&#8217;t spread evenly throughout the island. Known hot spots include the State Forest and the area around the UMass field station in Quaise.&#160;Ticks don&#8217;t like direct sunlight and are often found in&#160; shaded,&#160;moist&#160;areas around the edges of brush.&#160;\n\r\n&#160;\n\r\nClick here&#160;to sign up for &#8220;Above the Fold,&#8221; The Inquirer and Mirror&#8217;s twice-weekly newsletter, bringing you both the news and a slice of island life, curated with content created by Nantucket&#8217;s only team of professionally-trained journalists.\n\r\nFor up-to-the-minute information on Nantucket&#8217;s breaking news, boat and plane cancellations, weather alerts, sports and entertainment news, deals and promotions at island businesses and more, Sign up for Inquirer and Mirror text alerts.&#160;Click Here\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t","title":"Lyme disease cases spiking on Nantucket this year","url":"https://www.ack.net/news/20201029/lyme-disease-cases-spiking-on-nantucket-this-year","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1603853318,"author":null,"dateadded":"2020-10-27 19:52:35","comment":null,"excerpt":"More businesses set to reopen as some restrictions are lifted for San Mateo County  The Almanac Online","extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"Four counties in the greater Bay Area moved into a less-restrictive coronavirus reopening tier Tuesday, allowing them to reopen more businesses and expand indoor operations for already-open businesses like restaurants and religious facilities.Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties all moved from Tier 2, the red tier, to Tier 3, the orange tier, in the state's four-tiered reopening system following decreases in their testing positivity rates and their rates of new cases.","highlight2":"In many cases, all four counties will be able to expand the maximum capacity of indoor businesses from 25% to 50% or 200 people, whichever is fewer.Gyms, fitness centers and hotels will also be allowed to reopen indoor pools, while gyms themselves can increase their capacity from 10% to 25% of their maximum occupancy.Moving into the orange tier also allows multiple sectors like offices, cardrooms, bowling alleys, climbing walls and wineries to resume operating inside with caps on capacity.

The state agency had also determined that 114,442 of these units — or 25.9% of the total — should be designated for those in the \"very low\" income category.\nWhile the numbers for each city and county won't be formally adopted until early next year, the Association of Bay Area Governments offered a preview of what's to come on Oct. 15, when its Executive Board adopted a methodology for doling out the allocations, completing a complex and contentious exercise that began in fall 2019.\nThe committee, which consists of elected leaders from various ABAG jurisdictions, endorsed by a 24-9 vote the methodology developed by its Housing Methodology Committee. That committee, which is chaired by Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín, concluded its year of deliberations on Sept. 18 by adopting what's known as Alternative 8A. Its decision was subsequently affirmed on Oct. 1 by ABAG's Regional Planning Committee and on Oct. 15 by the Executive Board.\nThe approved alternative tries to spread the responsibility for new housing throughout the Bay Area, though it does so unevenly. It directs most of the housing toward cities that have plenty of jobs and transportation services and that are deemed \"high opportunity\" areas based on economic, educational and environmental factors. It also looks to place additional obligations on cities that exhibit economic and racial exclusion. Nearly 60% of the obligation will go to the area's three largest cities — San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland. San Francisco would have to plan for 72,080 housing units, San Jose for 66,522 and Oakland for 27,286.\nSilicon Valley would see dramatic growth under the proposed scenario. Jurisdictions in Santa Clara County account for 143,550 of the units between 2023 and 2031, a third of the nine-county region's total allocation. Alameda County is a very distant second, with a 19% share and 85,689 total units.\nAlternative 8A creates two different methods for determining how many housing units each jurisdiction should build: one for low-income housing and another for market-rate housing. Allocation for housing units in the \"very low\" and \"low\" income categories would be primarily based on the existence of \"high opportunity areas\" in a given jurisdiction. That factor alone accounts for 70% of the allocation. The remaining 30% is split evenly between two factors: the ability to reach a job by car within 30 minutes and the ability to reach a job by transit within 35 minutes.\nFor \"moderate\" and \"above moderate\" units, 60% of the allocation is based on job proximity by an automobile, while the other 40% is based on access to \"high opportunity areas.\"\nThe housing numbers are particularly eye-popping in Palo Alto and in Mountain View, two cities that enjoy a wealth of jobs, quality schools, Caltrain access and a broad swath of census tracts listed as \"highest opportunity\" on the state housing department's \"opportunity map.\" Alternative 8A assigns 10,058 housing units to Palo Alto, which includes 4,055 units in the \"very low\" and \"low\" income categories, between 2023 and 2031 — a reach for a city that has consistently failed to meet its own target of 300 new units per year. If the city were to actually build this housing, the new units would represent a growth rate of 36%, higher than any other city in the county.\nMountain View is expecting an assignment of 11,380 units, with 4,532 of them in the two lowest income categories. Its growth rate would be 33%, according to ABAG.\nThe cities of Santa Clara and Sunnyvale would be asked to plan for 12,047 and 12,998 housing units, respectively, though because they have larger populations the additional housing represents growth rates of 26% and 23%, respectively.\nThe Oct. 15 decision is not yet final. Residents and cities will have a chance to offer comments to ABAG before final housing allocations are released. Even so, the Executive Board's vote represented a major milestone for a yearlong process that featured dozens of meetings involving housing advocates, builders, county supervisors and council members from ABAG's region. Even after Alternative 8A emerged as the favored consensus of the majority, many members expressed all sorts of concerns about the adopted approach.\nOfficials from Napa and Sonoma counties warned about the perils of requiring heavy growth in environmentally sensitive areas that may be vulnerable to wildfires. Their counterparts from San Francisco and East Palo Alto advocated for more equity and greater obligations for historically exclusive communities.\nRepresentatives from Contra Costa County warned that methodology that allocates too many units into \"high opportunity\" areas creates an impossible burden small communities that will not be able to accommodate the growth. A coalition of cities from Contra Costa County proposed an alternative that would shift additional allocations to the south bay, saddling the region with 44% of the Bay Area's total housing allocation, compared to 42% under Alternative 8A.\n\"Many in the surrounding regions are concerned that they are set up to fail under this option 8A, since none of the allocations will actually result in actual housing creation,\" Matt Rodriguez, city manager of San Pablo, told the Executive Board at its Oct. 15 meeting.\nDavid Hudson, a council member in San Ramon who sits on the Executive Board, also opposed Alternative 8A, arguing that he believed it does not place a heavy enough housing obligation on the jobs-heavy south bay. The region, he said, is projected to receive about two-thirds of the Bay Area's new jobs and its housing obligations should match that. Requiring any less housing, he said, would merely \"continue the pattern we have in the last quarter of a century,\" with south bay cities producing far more jobs than housing.\nPalo Alto leaders worry about Alternative 8A for the exact opposite reason. The regional mandate, they have argued in a series of letters to ABAG, represents an impossible task.\n\"It is fundamentally not reasonable to accept that some jurisdictions will bear the burden of increasing its housing stock upwards of 25% to 40% over the next eight years,\" Palo Alto City Manager Ed Shikada wrote to the ABAG Executive Board last month. \"Not since the end of World War II have established Bay Area communities seen such unprecedented growth.\n\"Beyond that, consider the actual feasibility of adding 10,000 new housing units in a small to medium size jurisdiction. Higher property values, less land, less federal and state funding to subsidize housing, and known limitations on existing infrastructure all conspire against the ambitious and unachievable housing goals being contemplated by the Committee.\"\nOn the other side of the debate are those who believe that wealthy communities have an obligation to go even further in creating low-income housing. East Palo Alto Vice Mayor Carlos Romero, who serves as vice chair of ABAG's Regional Planning Committee, and Oakland Councilmember Nikki Fortunato Bas, a member of the ABAG's Executive Board, both supported adding an \"equity adjustment\" to the housing methodology. This adjustment would be applied to 49 jurisdictions that are \"exhibiting above average racial and socioeconomic exclusion,\" a list that includes Menlo Park and Palo Alto.\nThe adjustment, Romero explained, \"essentially ensures that every exclusive city or county receives a fair share of the region's very low and income and low income RHNA.\" Their alternative, known as 6A, would have created a \"floor\" for the number of \"low income\" and \"very low income\" units these jurisdictions have to accommodate.\n\"This helps eliminate segregated living patterns and opens communities so that Bay Area residents can choose where to live based on needs and preferences, not their racial and economic background,\" Romero said at the Oct. 15 meeting.\nRomero ultimately voted with a majority of the Regional Planning Committee on Oct. 1 to support Alternative 8A. Greg Scharff, a former Palo Alto mayor who also serves on the committee, voted against the proposed methodology. The regional plan, he said, should factor in recent changes in commuting patterns, including the recent push by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to shift 60% of employees to telecommuting.\nScharff also suggested that focusing housing allocation on expensive areas will make the housing more difficult to build.\n\"I do worry we're going to create less housing than if we look at it in other ways,\" Scharff said. \"One of the goals should be to create as much housing as possible.\"\nDespite the conflicting reservations, all three of the committees that reviewed Alternative 8A ultimately voted to approve it. Mountain View Council member Chris Clark, who sits on ABAG's Executive Board, spoke for many when he called it a suitable compromise.\n\"I believe that with option 8A we have arrived at what is a hallmark of a compromise where no one is 100% satisfied with something but no one is 100% dissatisfied with the outcome,\" Clark said.\nThe debate over housing methodology is expected to continue over the next month, as ABAG moves ahead with the comment period on its proposed methodology. After receiving and responding to comments in November, the agency plans to vote on a draft methodology in December. After the appeal period, the agency would formally release each city's allocations in 2021.\n\"It's fair to say, we're at the beginning of the home stretch,\" Matt Maloney, director of regional planning at ABAG said at the Oct. 15 meeting.\nRegional Housing Needs Allocation, he told the Board, is a \"tough process.\"\n\"The number we received from the state, 441,000, is much bigger than last time, when it was 187,000. So there is sticker shock and it's also a zero-sum game, so any change that results in a jurisdiction getting less means someone else gets more,\" he said.\nIn Palo Alto, city leaders are pursuing a two-pronged strategy: protesting the allocations and planning for their adoption. In a memo last week, Planning Director Jonathan Lait called ABAG's allocation of more than 10,000 units to Palo Alto \"unreasonable.\"\n\"It is practically infeasible for a jurisdiction the size of Palo Alto to drastically increase the number of housing units in a short period of time,\" the report states.\nWhile the city is not required to actually build all the housing in the allocation, it is required to update its Housing Element to identify the sites that can accommodate the units, as well as the strategies that the city is pursuing to enable development. This could include rezoning commercial sites to residential use and relaxing development standards to allow more housing units.\nSome members of the City Council believe the entire RHNA process is critically flawed and reject the notion that the city could — or should — try to meet the regionally adopted targets. In July, shortly after the state housing department determined that the Bay Area region needs to plan for 441,000 new units, Vice Mayor Tom DuBois and council members Eric Filseth and Lydia Kou co-authored a letter to Shikada, City Attorney Molly Stump and Lait expressing their objections to the agency's growth figures.\nThe numbers, they argued in the July 9 letter, are based on \"an aggressive and unrealistic job growth projection for the Bay Area and Silicon Valley in particular — even before COVID-19.\"\n\"These jobs growth numbers have been translated into unachievable housing growth rates, especially affordable housing growth rates, that simply cannot be met under any zoning without massive outside investments — subsidies which have never been forthcoming in the past, and are unlikely to appear in the future,\" the letter states. \"The HCD plan represents a gigantic unfunded mandate.\"\nAt the same time, council members and planners recognize that the RHNA, which was once relatively easy to ignore, is starting to grow some teeth. Under Senate Bill 35, cities that fall well short of their targets in particular income categories will lose some of their power to say no to new developments in these categories. The 2017 law creates a streamlined approval process in these communities, requiring approval of housing developments within either 60 days or 90 days, depending on the number of units. In addition, these developments would be allowed to dedicate 10% of their units to below-market-rate housing, below the city's normal standard of 15%.\nDuring an Oct. 5 discussion of the city's newly created \"planned housing zone,\" Lait told the council that the city has an interest in meeting the SB 35 thresholds to \"maintain local control.\" Otherwise, housing developments would be approved by right, with no design review and, in some instances, with substantial breaks on parking, Lait said.\nOthers welcome the RHNA process as an opportunity to implement some much-needed changes. During the council's Sept. 21 discussion of affordable housing, Mayor Adrian Fine observed that while some dismiss the city's allocation of more than 10,000 units as \"crazy,\" the process also creates an opportunity for the city to \"exercise local control.\"\n\"I think it's good for our community to create new neighborhoods and places for new families,\" Fine said. \"It's also good in terms of our diversity and, frankly, it begins to fulfill a small part of the regional obligations, which I know some of us have issues with, but that hammer isn't getting any softer.\"\n\n","title":"Bay Area's new growth plan eyes massive housing influx in Silicon Valley","url":"https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2020/10/22/bay-areas-new-growth-plan-eyes-massive-housing-influx-in-silicon-valley","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1603460121,"author":null,"dateadded":"2020-10-23 12:33:54","comment":"More NIMBYism on the peninsula.

It looks pretty elegant. I like that there are two stories of housing. But it troubles me that we don&#8217;t have more housing,&#8221; he said.\nO&#8217;Brien maintained a different perspective, suggesting officials have approved a slate of residential development that is yet to be built at a time when housing prices are dropping throughout the Bay Area amid the pandemic.\n&#8220;It is becoming so much more affordable.

Three others who were picnicking with woman were hospitalized in the tragedy as well.\nWith hopes of preventing future accidents, officials supported the proposal to examine an additional nearly 2,000 trees.\n&#8220;With the tragedy at Washington Park, I think we were all mortified by it,&#8221; said Ortiz.\naustin@smdailyjournal.com\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \n    \n\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                ","title":"Admiration but inaction for Burlingame development | Local News","url":"https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/admiration-but-inaction-for-burlingame-development/article_ba85da3a-14e0-11eb-b48a-5bb5f347611d.html","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1603404254,"author":"Jay Barmann","dateadded":"2020-10-22 22:00:36","comment":null,"excerpt":"The relentlessness of 2020 with its anxieties and miseries lumbers on with yet another fire weather forecast that no one wants to hear.

Furthermore, he questioned where communities such as South San Francisco, which have sustained long stretches of development over recent years, could find available land to build the housing allocation.\n&#8220;Where are we going to put these units?&#8221; he asked rhetorically. For his part, Rentschler said regional officials are committed to working with local jurisdictions to develop a plan that can facilitate the construction.\n\n&#8220;Four-hundred-and-forty-one-thousand housing units over eight years is a big lift for the region, and we acknowledge some jurisdictions will have challenges prioritizing eligible sites,&#8221; said Rentschler.\nUnder the most recent allocations, Daly City is expected to build 4,827 units; South San Francisco will be expected to build 3,978 units; San Mateo would be expected to build 6,697 units; Redwood City would be expected to build 5,199 units; Burlingame would be expected to build 3,449 units; Brisbane would be expected to build 2,819 units; and Millbrae and San Carlos would be expected to build roughly 2,300 units each.\nMeanwhile, smaller local communities would be spared the obligation to build as many units. For comparison, Hillsborough would be expected to build 606 units; Portola Valley would be expected to build 251 units; Woodside would be expected to build 326 units; and Half Moon Bay would be expected to build 342 units.\nCanepa suggested previously proposed methodologies would have more evenly distributed the housing allocations, and not overburdened communities with concentrated job centers.\n&#8220;If we are talking about regionalism, we should share the burden,&#8221; said Canepa, who echoed Garbarino&#8217;s equity concerns regarding the obligation of South San Francisco and other cities to build so many units while others are not expected to do so.\nNot all were critical of the mandates though, as officials with the county Housing Leadership Council called for more development &#8212;&#160;specifically affordable housing.\nFor each total allocation, a price range of units is assigned to be built as well spanning from very low income to above moderate income. The allocations identified are not final, but representative of the estimated amount each community must construct.\nWith a majority of the local affordable units allocated in San Mateo, Redwood City and Daly City, organizer Ken Chan complimented the regional organization on its methodology while calling for more similar development in neighboring communities.\n&#8220;[The Housing Leadership Council] would like to see a higher allocation for the entire region and the distribution that will create the most equity in the future,&#8221; he said in an email.\nThe ABAG executive board meets Thursday, Oct. 15, at 6 p.m. Visit abag.ca.gov/meetings for more information.\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \n    \n\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                ","title":"Housing plan targeting Bay Area","url":"https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/housing-plan-targeting-bay-area/article_82c35eae-0e9d-11eb-b6c3-ab226e29a182.html","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1602752411,"author":"Seth Godin","dateadded":"2020-10-15 9:21:59","comment":null,"excerpt":"There’s the unalterable momentum of physical objects as understood by physics: objects in motion tend to remain that way.

In neighboring Syria, half a million died between 2011 and 2016, and millions more were displaced. There are signs of life in Syria, but no sign of living. Everything Iran touches dies, and its regime extends its malign influence wherever it can. The civil war devastating Yemen began when the Iran-backed Houthis overthrew the Yemeni government in 2011. The Gaza Strip has been a totalitarian quasi-state since the terrorist organization Hamas seized the territory, which it continues to misgovern with financial and military aid provided by Iran.\n\nIn Iraq, Iran’s influence began in the mid-2000s during the American-led war to topple Saddam Hussein. That war produced two problems: An insurgency and a sectarian civil war, and Iran was happy to inflame both by supporting Shi’ite militias as they murdered Iraqi Sunnis and American peacekeepers. In 2011, the United States was negotiating an extension to its military presence in Iraq in order to protect the fragile democracy there. Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ notorious Quds Force, summoned Iraqi politicians and demanded that they reject US requests: The Americans will leave you one day, he told them, but we will always remain your neighbors. The Americans failed to reach an extension agreement and when they eventually left, Iranian influence inside Iraq only grew. The Iraqi democracy, for which the United States and its allies had sacrificed so much, continued to erode until anti-Iran protests erupted last year.\n\nIn Lebanon, the situation is even more distressing. Following the 1975–90 civil war, Lebanon became a flawed and frail democracy, but a democracy, nonetheless. Shi’ites, Sunnis, and Christians make up most of the country’s population, but Hezbollah, a Shi’ite sectarian militia backed by Iran, now operates as a state within a state, or, rather, the Lebanese state is now an arm of Hezbollah. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, Iranian support for Hezbollah grew, and at Tehran’s instruction, the group threw its support behind the genocidal regime of Bashar al-Assad. Heavily armed, richly funded, and now battle-hardened, Hezbollah’s grip on Lebanese politics tightened through bribery and armed intimidation. By the mid-2010s, there was almost nothing left of the Lebanese democratic experiment, as corruption led to a precipitous decline in standards of living.\n\nAll over the Middle East, wherever one sees bloody mayhem, one invariably finds Iran’s footprints. Iran has no interest in being a positive agent in the region or beyond, and it is time for American policymakers to come to terms with this fact. Iran is funding radical mosques in Latin America, while Hezbollah is operating in Mexico and elsewhere. In South Asia, Iran has been developing an Afghan version of Hezbollah, called the Fatemiyoun Brigade. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Iran’s powerful paramilitary group, is developing a naval base in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, Iran is empowering America’s great power adversaries. Most worrisome is the forthcoming agreement to lend China an island in the Persian Gulf for a military base. Russia, too, has been a beneficiary of warm relations with Iran, and the two countries cooperated to thwart US attempts to facilitate a transition of power in Syria.\n\nMural on the south wall of the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran (David Gubler)\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is a revolutionary and ideological state. Part of this ideology, from which the state derives legitimacy, is Shi’ite imperialism, anti-Americanism, and anti-Zionism. In fact, the IRGC’s mission statement mentions that it is the corps’ goal to export the 1979 Islamic revolution. To expect the Islamic Republic to behave as a normal state is to expect it to stop being itself. As Dartmouth Professor Misagh Parsa has written in his book, Democracy in Iran, reform in Iran is not a reasonable objective, it is a fool’s errand. Four decades of engagement and attempts to engage Iran have failed to modify the regime’s behavior. Even the Iran nuclear deal only fueled Iran’s conventional aggressions in the region.\n\nThe good news is that the desire to see the back of the Islamic regime has never been stronger inside Iran, and outside it, Arab states are aligning co-operatively with Israel against the regional Iranian threat. Before the pandemic, protests were more common in Iran than ever, and the regime’s mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis has made it even more unpopular. An IRGC intelligence officer who defected reports that the regime’s popularity is in single digits among Iranians, which—if true—points to a complete collapse in its popular legitimacy even among its traditional base. Demographics are working against the regime, as well. Declining birth rates indicate a concomitant decline in religion, which is bad news for a theocracy.\n\nFurthermore, the Persian Shi’ite population is in relative decline. Credible statistics are scarce, but even official reports (which are almost certainly exaggerated) suggest that Persians constitute only 60 percent of the population, and the vast majority of minorities have historical grievances against the regime. A recent poll has found that 73 percent of the society object to compulsory hijab, a core value of the regime, while 58 percent personally do not want to observe hijab. 37 percent drink alcohol, despite the legal prohibition, and an additional eight percent do not drink because of a lack of access and not due to any religious objection or medical restriction. To make matters worse for the regime, 68 percent believe that religion should not be a source of legislation, even if religious factions are democratically elected, and only 32 percent identify as Shi’ite Muslims.\n\nThe regime is a victim of its own fanaticism, corruption, and incompetence. The failure of the reform movement in the 1990s and 2000s has convinced Iranians that the regime is incapable of change. After eight years of domestic and foreign policy mismanagement under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, it was hoped that the presidency of Hassan Rouhani would bring some pragmatism to governance. In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal with the United States and its partners that released frozen Iranian assets worth a quarter of the country’s GDP. Campaigning on this success, Rouhani was re-elected in a landslide. Just months after his second inauguration and before the re-imposition of US sanctions, however, hyperinflation and depression plunged the country back into economic crisis, and sparked unprecedented anti-regime protests.\n\nIranians have now realized that the problem is not the sanctions or Israel or America or its own “hardliners” but the Islamic regime in its entirety. The beneficiary of the regime’s unpopularity, on the other hand, has been the Israeli government. As I have reported elsewhere, Iranians are developing a more positive attitude towards Israel, and especially towards Prime Minister Netanyahu. Even during the spring and summer explosions inside Iran, which were almost certainly carried out by Israeli agents, Iranians did not rally around their flag, and some even celebrated the attacks on social media and thanked the United States and Israel.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has been the source of much evil in the Middle East. But for the first time in its history, it finds itself opposed by a coalition of the United States, Israel, the Arab countries, and its own people. By supporting democratic actors and anti-regime elements, this alliance can force the Islamic Republic to direct its resources to domestic security and in effect self-contain, while the bloc of anti-regime states provides external containment. Beset by internal unrest and economic strife, overextended in its costly foreign entanglements, and facing unprecedented unity from its external foes, the Islamic Republic has never looked more vulnerable. An end to the Revolutionary theocracy and the misery it has inflicted on its own people and the region since 1979 may finally be in sight.\n\n \n\nShay Khatiri is an MA student of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins University, Paul H.

Since its publication, he has increasingly acted as the country’s promoter, welcoming its growing strength and hoping it will take its rightful throne as soon as may be. His commentary does make clear, although without adverse comment, that China lacks democratic institutions. Nevertheless, his emphasis is on its efficiency and its strategic thinking—an ability, he writes, that the US, “locked in old ways of thinking” and with “hardened arteries,” no longer possesses.\n\nAs time has passed, Jacques has only become more bullish about China’s rise. In a recent video for China Daily, the hardline English language state newspaper, he forecasts that China’s world dominance will be complete by 2030. In the accompanying text, he adds that “the fact is that an international system led by China and the developing world will be much superior to one characterised by Western dominance, with the US and Europe accounting for less than 15 percent of the world population.” With charts and graphs, he stresses that China now leads the US in GDP as measured by purchasing power parity (it has since 2014) and will, in the next decade, overtake it on nominal GDP as well. Jacques believes that China is a “good global citizen,” even though it had no say in developing the rules which govern global relations. He finds it “disgraceful” that Western states, led by the US, blame China for its management of the pandemic. On the contrary, it has, he says, been wholly responsible and performed much better in dealing with COVID-19 than any other country.\n\nJacques’s work—When China Rules the World has been a bestseller—is not just an unusually strong endorsement from a Western source of wildly successful economic policies, it is also a forecast coupled with a recommendation that China’s system of rule ought to become universal. In the light of China’s success, and the West’s weakness—which Jacques stresses is already evident and will become more pronounced over the next decade—it’s necessary to take his position seriously. Is he right on the central issue? Is China’s rule the prime example for the future, and indeed an inevitable destination for Western states? And will Western populations, increasingly sceptical of the actions and characters of their politicians, turn to an illiberal system of enlightened, highly educated technocrats which cancels the disputes, delays, compromises, and grandstanding of competitive representative politics?\n\n          \n\nThe reduction in China’s poverty has been without parallel. The country’s opening to a semi-market economy allowed it to lift 850 million people out of poverty in the quarter-century before 2005. The UN Development Programme’s discussion paper on “China, the Millennium Development Goals and the Post-2015 Development Agenda” states:\n\nOver a relatively short time span starting from China’s reform and opening-up since late 1970s, China has substantially reduced extreme poverty, infant, child, and maternal mortality rates; increased access to primary and secondary education; and made important gains in gender equality and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. This means that millions of people now have a steady supply of healthy food, safe drinking water, reliable shelter, and sanitation facilities. It also means that boys and girls have equal opportunities to receive education from the primary level to university, which can lead to better jobs and steady income for their families.\n\nThe improvement in peoples’ working lives, security, opportunities for education, leisure, and more fulfilling and equal personal relationships have been immense. The Chinese Communist Party introduced and controlled the opening of the economy, and with these reforms it made massive gains in credibility and public support, and continues to do so. Its credibility was in need of rescue. During the Great Leap Forward between 1958 and 1962, imposed by then-Party leader Mao Zedong, deaths from the resulting famine totalled somewhere between 15 million (the official estimate) and 45 million, a figure estimated from later research by Frank Dikötter, author of Mao’s Great Famine. And with the starvation came a wave of brutality, commanded by the Party, in which 2–3m were executed or tortured to death for the slightest infraction.\n\nIt seems that the turn to the market has worked. From my own limited contacts, mainly with Chinese journalists some years ago, many take the view that China’s increased wealth, social stability, and global status mean they can trust the Party, or at least acquiesce in its rule. A few—often without jobs in journalism due to past excesses of investigative zeal—mourn the passing of a period of relative freedom for their trade from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. But they count for little to a leadership which presides over a media world in which—as Xi emphasized soon after taking the presidency—the Communist Party is firmly in control, not just of Party media but of all media. David Bandurski, the editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, has said that “the sense is, ‘we own you, we run you, we tell you how things work. The party is the centre, and you serve our agenda.’ This is much more central now, and it’s being defined for all media platforms, from social media to commercial media.”\n\nWhat has emerged under Xi is an approach that rests on four mutually supportive pillars. These are:\n\n\nLeninism, the central and unopposable power of the Communist Party over every facet of Chinese life.\nConfucianism, recently pressed into service, its main characteristics of loyalty, consideration, and righteousness emphasised in ways that make them appear a good fit with communism.\nCapitalism, disguised as “communism with Chinese characteristics” and kept in check by the widely understood proviso that the party will always retain control over even the most powerful corporation.\nRissentiment, or the assignation of one’s frustration or opposition to a particular cause. In China’s case, this cause is its “years of humiliation” at the hands of Western imperialists in the decades of the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th—a way of strengthening nationalist feeling through hatred of foreign enemies.\n\nIn a recent book entitled The Rise of the Civilizational State, the London School of Economics international relations scholar Christopher Coker emphasises that communism in China is an ironic conception, given its promotion of free market individualism; that its definition of Confucianism excises the philosophy’s central concern, that of the need for justice; and that its version of past humiliations, weaponised to rouse the indignation of its citizens, rests on much bad history. Still, it works well, and underpins the Party’s claims to legitimacy and demands for obedience. And its future as a “far superior” global hegemon? The reason for believing that this will come to be seen widely as a model to copy lies in China’s success in achieving vastly ambitious goals under the proactive guidance of its unique governance. It is thus arguably in much better shape to face the constellation of threats, many of them existential, than Western governments which presently stumble with only one of these—the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn the United States, the presidency of Donald Trump has degraded executive power and widened existing splits in the country. In an essay for Foreign Affairs, Suzanne Mettler and Robert C. Lieberman write that:\n\n[Previous] crises of democracy did not occur randomly. Rather, they developed in the presence of one or more of four specific threats: political polarization, conflict over who belongs in the political community, high and growing economic inequality, and excessive executive power. When those conditions are absent, democracy tends to flourish. When one or more of them are present, democracy is prone to decay. Today, for the first time in its history, the United States faces all four threats at once.\n\nThe European Union has not, in more than a half-century, succeeded in becoming the federal state its founders—and American administrations—wished it to be. Its foreign policy is weak, it has no unified military, and it remains dependent on NATO—that is, the US—for defence. Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel, discreetly the most powerful figure in Europe, will not seek re-election next year. The French president Emmanuel Macron is positioning himself as the leader of a more unified Europe—a move that is unlikely to be accepted—while continuing to face strong domestic opposition. The UK’s prime minister Boris Johnson presently faces growing opposition to a haphazard governing style, while Britain’s exit from the EU, voted for in a 2016 referendum, will be disruptive to its economy, at least in the short term. All EU states face continuing waves of COVID-19, and when these subside, all will face vast debts and reduced GDP (while China’s GDP is forecast to increase, even if only at one percent, in 2021).\n\nThe problems facing the globe will tend to force governments to exercise greater control over their populations. The coming crises, which could lead to popular demands for more state intervention and control, include the following:\n\n\nClimate change: The remedies required by global warming will include draconian measures, some of which will result from public demand. If temperatures rise between one and three degrees centigrade, there will be heavier rainfalls leading to more frequent and larger floods; droughts will become more common; the sea levels will rise by between one and eight feet by 2100; the Arctic could be largely ice-free by 2050 and summers’ heat will be more and more extreme. All of these developments will call for state intervention of some kind—in building and maintaining flood barriers, cutting water use; providing defences against sea levels, moving populations inland and protecting vulnerable groups from oppressive temperatures. Some will tend to lead to heavily policed regulations, with fines and even imprisonment for their breach.\nPandemics: The main lesson gleaned from the COVID-19 experience by governments is to institute a policed lockdown. In many states, protests have been organised against (relatively mild) lockdowns, and these could spiral into the creation of major movements of opposition, requiring police and even army intervention.\nMigration: Increased migrant flows are likely to meet with resistance in destination states, particularly those with wealthier economies. Stronger protection against mass immigration attempts will be demanded: police, military, coastguard, and other security forces may have to be deployed, and the scope for conflict will be large.\nFood and water shortages: In poor countries, shortages will necessitate relief efforts, which may become hazardous if the distress in these countries is acute and produces violence against Western humanitarian missions. Droughts and famine will create extra incentives for desperate efforts to reach wealthy countries.\nArtificial intelligence: The growth of AI and automation will lead to mass layoffs, rising economic hardship, and growing opposition on the streets.\nNuclear proliferation: The spread of nuclear weapons and other WMDs will lead to a greater militarisation of states and tougher domestic security regimes.\nInequality: Greater social conflict in the Western democracies over issues of discrimination and economic justice (access to housing and goods) will radicalise younger generations, throwing yet another burden on law and order forces.\nWeakening international institutions: The possible failure of organisations such as the United Nations, the European Union, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Health Organisation, and other bodies, would mean a reduction in the availability of aid and crisis management by experienced teams.\nThe disunity of the United States: Since the end of World War II, the US has been the leader of the West, and of the democratic bloc of states. For most of that time, and particularly since the late-60s, it has suffered internal political rifts, especially around matters of war and race. The latter of these is presently prominent once more, as protests against police violence have again resulted in widespread demonstrations. These were accompanied in some areas by looting and violent rioting, with a few confrontations between the Black Lives Matter protestors and far-Right groups. These could worsen dramatically.\n\nAn overarching fear now is growing that the American democratic and electoral systems are themselves now endangered by two more immediate threats: First, if COVID-19 continues to make a drear harvest of American lives, especially elderly ones, while China’s infection and death rates remain low. Second, if the result of the presidential election in November is disputed.\n\nPresently, China has succeeded in controlling the virus better than many Western democracies and large democratic-authoritarian states like India and Brazil, both of which have seen surging numbers of infections. China’s present record has done much to dispel allegations of duplicity surrounding the emergence of an epidemic in Wuhan, and the pressure it is alleged to have exerted on the World Health Organisation. Indeed, such allegations may have been exaggerated, as an extensive investigation by Philippe Lemoine for Quillette has indicated. Notwithstanding its resistance to calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the disease, China’s record of suppression compares favourably to the chaotic attempts to manage the virus by the Trump administration. In an essay for Foreign Affairs, Francis Fukuyama writes:\n\nThe global distribution of power will continue to shift eastward, since East Asia has done better at managing the situation than Europe or the United States. Even though the pandemic originated in China and Beijing initially covered it up and allowed it to spread, China will benefit from the crisis, at least in relative terms. As it happened, other governments at first performed poorly and tried to cover it up, too, more visibly and with even deadlier consequences for their citizens. And at least Beijing has been able to regain control of the situation and is moving on to the next challenge, getting its economy back up to speed quickly and sustainably.\n\nThe United States, in contrast, has bungled its response badly and seen its prestige slip enormously. The country has vast potential state capacity and had built an impressive track record over previous epidemiological crises, but its current highly polarized society and incompetent leader blocked the state from functioning effectively. The president stoked division rather than promoting unity, politicized the distribution of aid, pushed responsibility onto governors for making key decisions while encouraging protests against them for protecting public health, and attacked international institutions rather than galvanizing them. The world can watch TV, too, and has stood by in amazement, with China quick to make the comparison clear.\n\nThe degradation of US politics has paralleled China’s efficiently managed growth of its economy, and an expansion of its influence worldwide. This cannot all be put at the door of Trump. In his forthcoming book The Upswing, the Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam argues that Americans have lurched too far from “earlier communitarian values” in favour of individualism. He quotes the philosopher Danielle Allen:\n\nWe think we are required to choose between freedom and equality. Our choice in recent years has tipped towards freedom. Under the general influence of libertarianism, both parties have abandoned our Declaration; they have scorned our patrimony. Such a choice is dangerous. If we abandon equality, we lose the single bond that makes us a community, that makes us a people with the capacity to be free collectively and individually in the first place.\n\nPresident Trump has tipped very far towards freedom, particularly his own, redefining the presidency as a narcissistic perch he appears increasingly reluctant to relinquish. He has refused to say unambiguously that he will leave if his opponent, Joe Biden, is awarded a clear victory, and has been energetically sowing doubt about the trustworthiness of postal votes in an apparent attempt to undermine the result. He has also warned that the contest will be, in some as yet unspecified way, “rigged”—either in the popular vote (which he lost in 2016), or in the crucial Electoral College (which he won). In the Atlantic, Barton Gellman writes that:\n\nThe worst case, however, is not that Trump rejects the election outcome. The worst case is that he uses his power to prevent a decisive outcome against him. If Trump sheds all restraint, and if his Republican allies play the parts he assigns them, he could obstruct the emergence of a legally unambiguous victory for Biden in the Electoral College and then in Congress. He could prevent the formation of consensus about whether there is any outcome at all. He could seize on that un­certainty to hold on to power.\n\nAn America consumed with fury on both sides would be a greater disaster than anything seen to date under Trump’s presidency, especially if it sparked widespread violence and armed confrontation in a heavily weaponised country. It would show the world that democratic institutions have no defence against the rage of a charismatic would-be tyrant. It would set the seal on the claim that a party of enlightened and decisive technocrats, with the interests of their citizens provably well-served across several decades, would be the better system. Were that to become a perceived truth held to be self-evident, China would become the engine for the spread of a system dependent on some variant of its present party monopoly. At which point, a second disaster would unfold.\n\n          \n\nFor China is no model for a modern state. It is an autocracy, generally congenial in the face it turns to the outside world, but cruel and despotic at home, and threatening to its immediate neighbours. Hundreds of Chinese citizens have been imprisoned for pursuing political freedom, accusing the state of corruption and suppression of human rights, and criticising Xi Jinping and other leaders of the Communist Party. Arch Puddington of Freedom House writes that:\n\nSince the bloody 1989 crackdown on prodemocracy protests in Tiananmen Square, the Communist Party leadership has consistently jailed political dissidents, especially those who argued publicly for democratic change. And under Xi Jinping, the regime has rapidly expanded the scope of its repression, engulfing a numbing procession of lawyers, journalists, bloggers, women’s advocates, minority rights campaigners, and religious believers who have been detained, placed under house arrest, disappeared, or formally sentenced to prison.\n\nA September 2020 study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that one third of the mosques in Xinjiang have been destroyed, the reversal of a trend for growth after the low point of the Cultural Revolution. An estimated one million citizens in Xinjiang, most of these Uighur Muslims, are estimated to be held in camps. A leaked memo sent by the deputy general secretary of the region’s Communist Party, Zhu Hailun, shows that these camps have been placed under ever-stricter regimes designed to make escape impossible, and to introduce stricter discipline, the promotion of “repentance and confession,” and forced learning of Mandarin.\n\nIn Tibet, a harsher regime is also now evident. According to Human Rights Watch, “authorities… continue to severely restrict religious freedom, speech, movement, and assembly, and fail to redress popular concerns about mining and land grabs by local officials, which often involve intimidation and arbitrary violence by security forces. Authorities intensified surveillance of online and phone communications.” In a separate report, Human Rights Watch writes of Hong Kong that:\n\nAuthorities have rapidly begun to apply the new National Security Law to prosecute peaceful speech, curtail academic freedom, and generate a chilling effect on fundamental freedoms in the city. The law, which China’s government imposed on June 30th, 2020, is Beijing’s most aggressive assault on Hong Kong people’s freedoms since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997… (provisions) include creating specialized secret security agencies, denying fair trial rights, providing sweeping new powers to the police, increasing restraints on civil society and the media, and weakening judicial oversight.\n\nTaiwan, the democratic breakaway from China, is now under growing pressure, as Chinese military jets routinely overfly its airspace. “China is completely open about the threat. President Xi Jinping framed it himself in a high-profile speech in 2019: ‘We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures.’” If it succeeds in taking the lead from the West in the coming decades, the Chinese Communist Party will rise to global power as a tyranny with no recognition of human rights or toleration for a civil society independent of Party and state. Its success would be a turn not towards efficiency, but to a particular kind of high-tech barbarism, in which dissent is routinely silenced and ethnic and religious differences ironed out. To ignore it—worse, to succumb to it in the name of efficiency—would be to destroy democratic civilisation.\n\nFreedom, democratic choice, independent institutions, the rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly and the press are all largely or wholly absent in China. But these characteristics are the legacy of centuries in the West—centuries, including the 20th, in which Western states were themselves despotic and murderous. In the past 75 years, the lessons of 1914–18 and 1939–45 appear to have been learned: Inter-state wars no longer happen in the Americas or in Europe (the Balkans being the exception).\n\nThe achievements of democratic government and active civil societies in the West since 1945 have been as stirring and remarkable as China’s economic growth. Advances in human and civil rights in every sphere of life, while rarely uncontentious (as democracy prescribes) have accompanied liberal reforms of social welfare, greater access to medical care, and a huge expansion of education. However tarnished, these remain the glory of liberal democratic rule, whether of the Right or the Left. They may also be, in the long run, the way in which societies under pressure best restore themselves, as a thousand civil safety valves maintain a—sometimes, as now, rocky—equilibrium.\n\nHave the West’s electorates become so disappointed and distrustful of these values and practices—so spoiled, so hooked on pleasure and entertainment—that they are a pushover for the disciplined cadres and cowed populations of the authoritarian states? Is an authoritarian state, a Leviathan capable of suppression of conflicts, the only recourse we will soon have?

Here was my paraphrased tweet about it:\n\nWith a very effective vaccine ready in Nov/Dec, distributed widely, and if lots of people take it (i.e. the best case scenario), the earliest we could return to “normal life” in the world is the end of 2021.\n\nAt the New Yorker Festival earlier in the week, Michael Specter asked him about a return to normalcy and Fauci elaborated a bit more on this timeline (starts ~10:22 in the video).\n\n\n\nWhen are we gonna get back to something that closely resembles, or is in fact, normal as we knew it?\n\nWe’re already making doses, tens and hundreds of millions of doses to be ready, first at least, in graded numbers at the end of the year in November/December. By the time we get to April, we likely will have doses to be able to vaccinate anybody who needs to be vaccinated. But logistically by the time you get everybody vaccinated, it likely will not be until the third or even the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSo let’s say we get a 70% effective vaccine, which I hope we will get, but only 60% of the people get vaccinated. There are going to be a lot of vulnerable people out there, which means that the vaccine will greatly help us to pull back a bit on the restrictions that we have now to maintain good public health, but it’s not going to eliminate things like mask wearing and avoiding crowds and things like that.\n\nSo I think we can approach normality, but I don’t think we’re going to be back to normal until the end of 2021. We may do better than that; I hope so but I don’t think so.\n\nLeaving aside what “normal” might mean and who it actually applies to,1 there’s some good news and bad news in there. The good news is, they’re already producing doses of the vaccine to be ready if and when the phase 3 trials are successful. Ramping up production before the trials conclude isn’t usually done because it’s a waste of money if the trials fail, but these vaccines are so critical to saving lives that they’re spending that money to save time. That’s great news.\n\nThe bad news is that we’re not even halfway through the pandemic in the best case scenario. We’re going to be wearing masks in public for at least another year (and probably longer than that). Large gatherings of people (especially indoors) will continue to be problematic — you know: movie theaters, concerts, clubs, bars, restaurants, schools, and churches — and folks staying within small pods of trusted folks will likely be the safest course of action.\n\nA change in national leadership in both the executive branch and Senate could change the outlook for the better. We could get some normalcy back even without a vaccine through measures like a national mask mandate/distribution, a real national testing &amp; tracing effort, taking aerosol transmission seriously, and easing the economic pressure to “open back up” prematurely. We’re never going to do as well as Vietnam or Taiwan, but I’d settle for Greece or Norway.\n\nIt’s America. If we know anything by now about this country, it’s that access to healthcare and economic opportunity is going to apply unevenly to the people who live here. For instance, it’s likely that Black &amp; brown communities, which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, may face difficulty in getting access to vaccines compared to wealthier, predominantly white communities.↩\n\nTags: Anthony Fauci   COVID-19   medicine   Michael Specter   science   USA   vaccines   video","title":"Dr. Fauci: Earliest We’ll Be “Back to Normal” Is the End of 2021","url":"https://kottke.org/20/10/dr-fauci-earliest-well-be-back-to-normal-is-the-end-of-2021","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1602065740,"author":"Fred Wilson","dateadded":"2020-10-08 10:00:30","comment":null,"excerpt":"I’m not a fan of business books.

As I recalled (and the title implies), this song has the depressing lyrics of pretty much all Soundgarden/Chris Cornell songs, and I remember thinking that this would be a pretty good theme song for the year. Covid and the election and protests and urban violence and massive wildfires and brain-eating amoebas in south Texas drinking water &#8230; these sure feel like Black Days that we&#8217;ve fallen into. 2020, amirite?\nBut before playing the track, there was a brief recorded interview with Chris Cornell from some years ago (he committed suicide in 2017) explaining what he was thinking when he wrote &#8220;Fell on Black Days&#8221; back in 1994. It wasn&#8217;t what I expected.\nHe said that the song is about waking up one morning and realizing with a start that your life and the world in general are &#8230; off. Not just a little off, but way, way waaaay off. And not because of some huge traumatic event. Not because you got really sick or you got fired or a meteor hit the Earth, but because of a thousand little events, each regrettable and yet oddly unremarkable in itself, each building on the others, each lost in the noise of the others, each noted with a sigh and then promptly forgotten. It&#8217;s the realization that you are the frog now sitting in boiling water, that you are the one suffering a death by a thousand cuts. It&#8217;s the realization that you&#8217;re not as happy as you used to be, that you&#8217;re not as secure as you used to be, that you&#8217;re not as healthy as you used to be. And it all just &#8230; happened. It all just snuck up on you unawares, like you were asleep or something.\nI know exactly what Chris Cornell is saying in this song. I bet you do, too.\n&#8220;Fell on Black Days&#8221; isn&#8217;t a theme song for 2020. \nIt&#8217;s a theme song for all the years that got us to 2020.\nAre you awake yet?\nThis is a picture of Chris Cornell with his daughter Toni. Looks like she&#8217;s what? Four years old? That would date this to 2008, fourteen years after he wrote &#8220;Fell on Black Days&#8221;.\nChris Cornell and I would be almost exactly the same age if he were still alive. We were both born in the summer of 1964.\nI&#8217;ve got a picture just like this. I&#8217;ve got a lot of pictures just like this. If you&#8217;ve got kids, I bet you do, too.\nHave you woken up to the realization that our nation and our world and your children&#8217;s place in that nation and that world are less secure and less healthy and less happy than a year ago? And that next year their place will be less secure and less healthy and less happy than this year?\nI have no frame of reference for the depression that led Chris Cornell to take his own life nine years after this photograph was taken. But I know exactly the feeling of love and pride and hope in this photograph, just like I know exactly the feeling of anger and pain and realization in &#8220;Fell on Black Days&#8221;. These are the feelings that motivate me in everything I do.\nThe threat of the future revealed itself to me in 1996 with the death of my father and the birth of my child. One day the threat of the future will reveal itself to you, if it hasn&#8217;t already. When it does, you will be CONSUMED by thoughts of the future. You will FEEL the pressure of time more keenly than the younger you could ever imagine.\nTick-tock.\nAre you awake yet?\nI don&#8217;t mean &#8220;woke&#8221;. I don&#8217;t mean entrapped in whatever mind-welding syllogism that marks some SJW initiation ceremony.\nI mean has Covid, BLM, the election &#8230; whatever car alarm you&#8217;re hearing in the middle of the night &#8230; has it shaken you awake from your pleasant dreams of &#8220;Yay, democracy!&#8221; and &#8220;Yay, capitalism!&#8221; ?\nHas it made you question your received truths of party or corporation or church or nation?\nHave you looked at some egregiously bullshit event over the past year and whispered to yourself quietly, oh-so quietly, Burn. It. The. Fuck. Down. ?\nAre you awake yet?I bet you are.Change is coming, and I don&#8217;t mean the change of an election on November 3rd.\nDoes the election matter? Of course it matters. It matters a lot. Four years ago I wrote that I thought Trump would win. I wrote that I thought this would be a historic tragedy. I wrote that I thought Trump would break us. And he did.\nBlowing up our international trade and security games with Europe, Japan, and China for the sheer hell of it, turning them into full-blown Competition Games &#8230; that&#8217;s really stupid. But we have a nasty recession and maybe a nasty war. Maybe it would have happened anyway. We get over it. Blowing up our American political game with citizens, institutions, and identities for the sheer hell of it, turning it into a full-blown Competition Game &#8230; that&#8217;s a historic tragedy. We don&#8217;t get over that.\nI don&#8217;t think people realize the underlying fragility of the Constitution &#8212; the written rules to our American political game. It&#8217;s just a piece of paper. Its only strength in theory is our communal determination to infuse it with meaning through our embrace of not only its explicit rules, but also and more crucially its unwritten rules of small-l liberal&#160;values&#160;like tolerance, liberty, and equality under the law.&#160;Its only strength in practice is that whoever runs our Executive branch, whoever is our Commander-in-Chief, whoever is in charge of &#8220;law and order&#8221;, whoever runs our&#160;massive spy bureaucracy&#160;national intelligence service, whoever controls the legitimate use of deadly force and incarceration &#8230; that he or she believes in those unwritten rules of small-l liberal values like tolerance, liberty, and equality under the law. When you hear Trump talk about &#8220;loosening the law&#8221; on torture, or &#8220;loosening the law&#8221; on libel prosecutions of anyone who criticizes HIM, or the impossibility of a federal judge being able to rule fairly because his parents were born in Mexico &#8230; well, there&#8217;s no way he believes in those small-l liberal virtues. No way.\nAnd yeah, I know what the supporters say, that he &#8220;really doesn&#8217;t mean what he says&#8221;, or that &#8220;once he&#8217;s elected he&#8217;ll listen to the right people and his views will evolve&#8221;, or &#8212; my personal fave &#8212; &#8220;it&#8217;s only 4 years, how bad can it be?&#8221; Answer: pretty damn bad. And yeah, I understand the argument on the Supreme Court. But what I&#8217;m talking about is bigger than the Supreme Court. A lot bigger.\n&#8212; Virtue Signaling &#8230; Or Why Clinton Is In TroubleSo yes, I totally pegged this four years ago. And no, I have no prediction on who wins this election.\nI&#8217;m over it.\nPlease hear me out.\nI don&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m not going to vote in four weeks. Of course I&#8217;m going to vote. I will vote as an expression of my political identity, and I&#8217;ll hope for the best. And I&#8217;ll prepare for the worst.\nBut no matter who is in the White House on January 20th, 2021 or January 20th, 2025, none of this ends. All of our coordination games are now competition games. That&#8217;s the new equilibrium. This is a permanent change. Covid is a permanent part of our world. Both the Republican and the Democratic parties are permanently transformed. The tether between taxation and spending &#8211; the core, most important relationship between government and governed &#8211; is permanently severed. There is no reset button. There is no saved game.\nSo what. Now what.\nNow we wake up. \nNow we recognize the scale and scope of what has been stolen from us over the past 40 years, a scale and scope that dwarfs the grifts and Il Duce cosplay of Donald Trump. Now we understand that our vote every four years is the merest, most insignificant part of our political participation.\nWe don&#8217;t play defense. We don&#8217;t content ourselves with avoiding the worst excesses of the Trumpist clownshow or the Socialist lunacies.\nNow we change the entire freakin&#8217; world. For ourselves, yes. For our children, even more.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s dreaming now,&#8221; said Tweedledee, &#8220;and what do you think he&#8217;s dreaming about?&#8221;\nAlice said, &#8220;Nobody can guess that.&#8221;\n&#8220;Why, about you!&#8221; Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly. &#8220;And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you&#8217;d be?&#8221;\n&#8220;Where I am now, of course,&#8221; said Alice.\n&#8220;Not you!&#8221; Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. &#8220;You&#8217;d be nowhere. Why, you&#8217;re only a sort of thing in his dream!&#8221;\n&#8220;If that there King was to wake,&#8221; added Tweedledum, &#8220;you&#8217;d go out &#8212; bang! &#8212; just like a candle!&#8221;&#160;\n&#8211;&#160;Lewis Carroll, &#8220;Through the Looking Glass&#8221; (1871)We&#8217;re all familiar with the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland, less so with the Red King. He&#8217;s sleeping all the while, and when Alice goes to wake him up she&#8217;s warned off by Tweedledee and Tweedledum, who tell her that everything in Wonderland &#8211; including Alice herself &#8211; is perhaps just the dream of the Red King. Wake him up and maybe, just maybe, everything goes &#8230; poof!\nThe Red King is us.\nEverything changes when we wake up from our dreaming world, when we no longer allow concentrated interests of wealth and power to nudge us back to sleep with their memes and soma.\nIt&#8217;s time to look beyond the November 3rd election, not because it doesn&#8217;t matter or it&#8217;s not worthy of your awake-for-the-first-time political participation, but because your awake-for-the-first-time political participation in the days and weeks and months and years and decades after November 3rd matters MORE.\nI think the events of 2020 have woken the Red King &#8230; us! &#8230; and we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to unmake the Black Days that were created around us while we slept, a once in a lifetime opportunity to realize our dreams of old, now long deferred.\nOur dreams &#8211; and our pledge &#8211; of liberty and justice for ALL.\nWhat happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up&#160;\nlike a raisin in the sun?&#160;\nOr fester like a sore &#8212;&#160;\nAnd then run?&#160;\nDoes it stink like rotten meat?&#160;\nOr crust and sugar over &#8212;&#160;\nlike a syrupy sweet?\n\nMaybe it just sags&#160;\nlike a heavy load.\n\nOr does it explode?&#160;\n\n&#8211;&#160;Langston Hughes, &#8220;Dream Deferred&#8221; (1951)\nMark me down for explode.\nWe need quantum change &#8211; meaning we must have change in the rules of the system, meaning that we must have change in the state of the system &#8211; because once you fall into the stable equilibrium of our Black Days, it is impossible for incremental change or adjustment to get you out. Not just difficult. Impossible. That&#8217;s what an equilibrium means. We cannot just open a door that has been welded shut. We must blow the door open.\nWe must Burn. It. The. Fuck. Down.\nWhich doors? All of &#8217;em. All of the welded shut doors of the institutions that steal our autonomy of mind, that use us for fodder and feed. What are those institutions? Literally every single institution of human civilization.\nHey, go big or go home.\nThese are the ten Great Guilds of human civilization, each now fully captured by smiley-face authoritarian concentrations of wealth and power, even as the rank-and-file members of these guilds dream a pleasant dream of days gone by.\n\nThe Artists Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of entertainment, art and fashion; not only &#8220;content&#8221; (to use the modern term) but also design, marketing and sport.\nThe Bankers Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of money as a thing; commercial and investment banks, yes, but also all financial services.\nThe Doctors Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of health; not only doctors and hospitals, but also all medical services, medical devices, healthcare payers and pharmaceuticals.\nThe Lawyers Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of law as a thing; lawyers and law firms, yes, but also all law-making and law-execution and law-deciding.\nThe Masons Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of construction; the building of structures and infrastructure, including telecom/network infrastructure.\nThe Miners Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of natural resource extraction, for my purposes including renewable resources, agricultural resources, and constructed resources like semiconductors.\nThe Mercenaries Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of organized protection and the legal use of force, including soldiers, police and &#8220;security contractors&#8221;.\nThe Merchants Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of business as a thing; in the modern context, all of professional corporate management.\nThe Teachers Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of knowledge as a thing; not only education but also scientific, technical and engineering research.\nThe Thieves Guild &#8212; the human endeavor of organized crime and the illegal use of force; yes, this is one of the pillars of human civilization.How did this happen? How were the Great Guilds of human civilization captured while we slept?\nThrough the systematic use of securitization, leverage, scale and alienation.\n\nSecuritization&#160;&#8212; the derivative connection of something in the real world with a piece of paper that can be bought and sold separately from that real world thing, with no impact on that real world thing; also known as a casino chip.\nLeverage&#160;&#8212; borrowed money.\nScale &#8212; increased size generating a more than proportional increase in power.\nAlienation &#8212; the process that transforms a human from making a cog to being a cog &#8230; and liking it.These are the instruments of our Black Days. Sometimes used in unison, sometimes used separately, these are are TOOLS by by which smiley-face authoritarian concentrations of wealth and power have perverted all of our human endeavors. Application of securitization, leverage, scale and alienation is the PROCESS by which our Black Days were created.\nUnderstanding the process is everything.\nBecause if I&#8217;m right about the process &#8230; then we have a blueprint for how to reverse it.\n\n\nHow do we fix the world?By burning away the overwhelming levels of securitization, leverage, scale and alienation built up in every aspect of human civilization.You may know these words by another name.\nLeverage + Securitization = FinancializationScale + Alienation = NeoliberalismYou know, in one of my Twitter spats with Angry Billionaire&#8482; Cliff Asness, he proclaimed that the word &#8220;financialization&#8221; was not used by any serious person. By this he meant (I think) that it was a vague, mushy term tossed around for affect by people who had some inchoate beef with capitalism or wealth inequality or the like. A word full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\nCliff was right.\nAlmost always, &#8220;financialization&#8221; is a word bandied about for emotional appeal. Almost always, it&#8217;s a verbal form of jazz hands, shorthand for &#8220;there&#8217;s something here that seems unfair or unjust to our woke sensibilities, so let&#8217;s all just agree that it&#8217;s bad by nodding our heads at the term&#8221;. At best, financialization is understood as Justice Potter Stewart understood pornography &#8230; we can&#8217;t define it, but we know it when we see it. Ditto with &#8220;neoliberalism&#8221;. Frankly, I think &#8220;neoliberalism&#8221; is even worse.\nIt&#8217;s incumbent on those of us who believe something is fundamentally and structurally WRONG with the way power and wealth are distributed in the modern world to choose our words with precision and care. I don&#8217;t mean that we have to be boring or pedantic. I mean that the burden of proof is on us to show that the current system is, in fact, structurally broken, and the best way to do that is to use our words like a scalpel, slicing away the skin of pleasant narrative and deceit to reveal the sinews of raw power beneath. &#160;\nWhat is financialization? It&#8217;s the application of securitization and leverage.\nWhat is neoliberalism? It&#8217;s the application of scale and alienation.\nHOW are they applied to the Great Guilds of human civilization to make our Black Days? \nHOW do they strip away our life, our liberty, and our pursuit of happiness?\nHOW can we reverse this?\nUsually I&#8217;d write a series of notes to answer these questions and post them on the Epsilon Theory website. In this case that seems &#8230; small. It seems like a bad move in the metagame! Why? Because the words I&#8217;m writing are threatening words to these concentrated interests of wealth and power and their Renfields. Because the words I&#8217;m writing can and will be used against me and anyone who chooses to act on those words with me. They will intentionally be taken out of context.

Testing would be available by appointment, with results available in 15 minutes, and the airline hoped the $250 price point would come down in the near future. \n\nSince then Hawaiian Airlines also announced same day airport testing coming for its passengers for $150. The State of Hawaii plans to allow people to enter the state without 14 day quarantine starting October 15, provided they present a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours of arrival. United says the state will accept their Abbott rapid tests.\n\nNow Oakland airport is announcing that its Hawaii passengers can get rapid tests for free starting October 15.\n\n\nThe testing program opens to airport and airline employees starting October 6, and to passengers October 15.\n\nTests are by appointment and the location of CityHealth Urgent Care, which will perform the tests, is at the airport’s North Field terminal which is on the opposite side of the airport from passenger terminals. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAccording to the airport, OAK recommends that travelers test the day before. If travelers wait until the day of departure, they should arrive three hours before departure, get tested (have the results in 15 minutes which are electronically sent to the State of Hawaii) and then check-in for their flight.\nNon-stop flights to Hawaii from Oakland are offered by Southwest Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. Many passengers can get testing with no out of pocket cost through other providers, using their insurance or public health resources, but at-airport testing makes the travel process more convenient and rapid testing addresses frequent delays of lab results.\n\nFor a family of four or five, free tests versus $150 to $250 per person, could serve as a competitive advantage for Oakland airport as a departure point for Hawaii travel versus San Francisco. Nearby San Jose airport says they’re exploring their own testing program, too.\n\nThese efforts are so far limited to Hawaii, but don’t expect it to stay that way. In October Tampa is trialing offering testing to all passengers and expects a $125 price point.\n\nWidespread testing give confidence to numerous destinations to allow in passengers without quarantine, and if an airline made testing mandatory to travel they’d give confidence to all passengers on board that everyone had tested negative for the virus – and that could reduce anxiety over travel significantly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"The Testing Wars Have Begun: Oakland Airport Wants To Attract Passengers With Free Rapid Covid Testing - View from the Wing","url":"https://viewfromthewing.com/the-testing-wars-have-begun-oakland-airport-wants-to-attract-passengers-with-free-rapid-covid-testing/","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1601478611,"author":"Jason Kottke","dateadded":"2020-09-30 19:46:50","comment":null,"excerpt":null,"extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"Last night in a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Donald Trump, the actual President of these United States, not only declined to condemn white supremacy, he gave an order to an openly white supremacist group on national television.","highlight2":"I understand the perfect candidate doesn’t exist and that our system of voting requires us to compromise some of our values in order to support progress towards bigger goals, but good luck explaining that you voted for an actual white supremacist to your grandchildren someday (if you can stomach telling them the truth).

Opponents of the measure are also convinced fewer and fewer people will use Caltrain moving forward in part because of the advent of work-from-home policies. &#160;\nIf approved by two thirds of the voters in San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, the tax will generate an estimated $108 million annually for 30 years. Caltrain currently gets the majority of its funding from fares along with contributions from the three counties it serves.\n\nWith ridership down 95% since the onset of the pandemic, Caltrain is facing an $18 million budget deficit that will deepen if riders don&#8217;t soon return. Only federal CARES Act funding is keeping the trains running and that money is quickly running out, officials say.\n&#8220;If we don&#8217;t have the sales tax we&#8217;re out of revenue and we&#8217;ll very likely have to stop the passenger service or radically reduce it,&#8221; said Dave Pine, the chair of Caltrain&#8217;s board of directors and also a San Mateo County supervisor. &#8220;It&#8217;s very much an existential threat to the railroad.&#8221;\nWithout Caltrain, residents can expect traffic congestion to be worse than it was before the pandemic, proponents of the measure argue.\n&#8220;Voting yes on RR will remove thousands of cars from our highways every day,&#8221; reads the official ballot argument against the measure. &#8220;Without Caltrain, traffic congestion will soon be worse than before COVID-19.&#8221;\nBut opponents believe Caltrain ridership will never return to prepandemic rates given the rising popularity of working from home. &#160;&#160;\n&#8220;Prepandemic levels they will never get back to,&#8221; said Jim Lawrence, a former Foster City mayor who wrote the ballot argument against the measure. &#8220;Every major corporation is saying they now work remotely. Many are even moving out of the Bay Area. So we&#8217;re not going to have this mass influx every day going up and down the Peninsula. It&#8217;s just not going to happen.&#8221;\nMeasure RR supporters, on the other hand, are confident ridership will return to prepandemic levels. That&#8217;s in part because there remains &#8220;strong interest&#8221; in development in the region and because telecommuting will not be as widespread as Lawrence believes, according to Don Cecil, with the San Mateo County Economic Development Association, or SAMCEDA.\n&#8220;When we talk to major employers yes they&#8217;ve made decisions like allowing employees to work from home permanently or allowing them to work from home until next June, but no one envisions a complete telecommute environment that I&#8217;m speaking with,&#8221; Cecil said.\nAdina Levin of the nonprofit Friends of Caltrain noted recent polling found 70% of people who were frequent users of Caltrain plan on using the railroad as much or more than before the pandemic.\n&#8220;The surveys of individuals also show people are planning to come back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People who are working from home while their small children run around in the background and they&#8217;re hearing maybe their housemate talk on the phone on their other Zoom call are eager to get back to the office.&#8221;\nLawrence also cited the regressive nature of sales taxes and the ongoing financial crisis as reasons to reject the Caltrain tax proposal.\n\n&#8220;Regressive taxes impact the lowest end of our economy and households the worst with no direct benefit back to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[Caltrain] is expensive, it&#8217;s not convenient for them and very few use it. &#8230; Why should the general public pay for something that less than 1% of the community uses?&#8221;\n&#8220;Riders of Caltrain are the upper end of the economy,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Household incomes [among riders] are approaching $200,000.&#8221;\nLevin countered 30% of Caltrain riders are considered low-income.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s not true that Caltrain is all affluent riders,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s 30% of people who are low-income who have been using the service historically. Also that is disproportionately lower than the share of low-income people who live near the corridor and work on the corridor. By making Caltrain more affordable, there are people that would be able to take advantage of that.&#8221;\nPine said &#8220;making Caltrain accessible to more riders is a key element of Measure RR.&#8221;\n&#8220;Fundamentally when you&#8217;re able to offer more service on different schedules it opens up the railway to a host of different types of riders,&#8221; he said, noting when electrification is complete in 2022, service will go from 92 trains per day to 168 trains per day. &#8220;That&#8217;s big growth and Measure RR helps to pay some of those operating expenses to get there.&#8221;\nPine also referenced a soon-to-launch pilot program offering 50% fare reductions to low-income riders.\n&#8220;To maintain that, Measure RR will be a big help,&#8221; he said.\nMark Hinkle of the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association said voters are being inundated with tax hikes at a time when many are out of work.\n&#8220;If you add up all the taxes that are going to be on the ballot in November it&#8217;s over $5 billion in tax increases at a time when people are being laid off, furloughed or working part time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Talking about kicking someone when they&#8217;re down. It&#8217;s absolutely the wrong time for a tax increase.&#8221;\nOn the other hand, the official ballot argument in favor of the Caltrain tax describes it as a &#8220;small price to pay&#8221; to save the railroad. &#160;\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall victim to the naysayers&#8217; scare tactics,&#8221; the argument reads. &#8220;Measure RR only adds one penny to an $8 purchase and essentials like groceries and medicine are exempt. That&#8217;s a small price to pay to prevent traffic congestion and save Caltrain.&#8221;\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \n    \n\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                ","title":"Measure RR seeks to save, grow Caltrain in San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties","url":"https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/measure-rr-seeks-to-save-grow-caltrain-in-san-mateo-san-francisco-and-santa-clara/article_d24c3e22-02d2-11eb-97f1-93a5fc8a2932.html","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1601432793,"author":null,"dateadded":"2020-09-29 19:40:31","comment":null,"excerpt":"State: Nantucket schools can't resume in-class learning for all students Oct. 1  The Inquirer and Mirror","extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"Most Nantucket public-school students will continue remote learning until at least Oct. 19, after the state education commissioner determined the island’s coronavirus numbers are too high for a return to class this Thursday, schools superintendent Beth Hallett said Tuesday night.","highlight2":"Half of the twice-a-week students will be allowed to return to school Oct. 19 and the other half Oct. 22, as long as Nantucket has fallen from a red coronavirus designation to yellow or lower, Hallett said.

The school systems join 27 private schools and one public school, Connect Community Charter in Redwood City, among those with waiver approvals.\nMagee said the plans submitted by other schools looking to reopen while the county is in the red tier will receive thorough evaluation by local education officials checking for alignment with safety framework and health officials checking testing and tracing policies.\nBecause so many district administrators have spent months planning for a safe return to campus, Magee said most have established testing policies. But for those districts needing further assistance, she expected the county office may be able to provide additional support.\nFor her part, Magee said school officials have shown great receptiveness to the aid offered by the county education and health offices, and appreciate the guidance during a uniquely challenging time.\n&#8220;The school leaders want to do this the right way,&#8221; she said, noting officials have been caught in the crossfire of many school community members with strongly held opinions on the best ways to reopen campuses.\nLooking ahead, Magee anticipated most schools will take a tiered approach in bringing students back to campus &#8212; meaning not all classrooms will be filled as soon as they are opened.\n\nTo that end, she noted most districts have already started allowing small groups of students with specialized needs back on campus. And even once larger groups returns, she said distance learning and online lessons will remain critical resources over the foreseeable future.\nThe opportunity to reopen campuses arrives just as many districts were hitting their stride in remote learning arrangements, said Magee, who added many middle and high schools will continue mostly with online classes for immediate future.\nOnline learning offers valued flexibility as well, which will be necessary if the county returns to the purple tier or if a school community experiences a COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe latter scenario remains a key concern for Magee, who acknowledged that allowing students back to campuses affects the likelihood of virus transmission.\n&#8220;We do have community spread.

And it is central to ensuring equity for everyone.\n\nI started thinking about this during a debate with my kids and their friends this summer about making college education free for everyone. I wondered whether that would just entrench the current ridiculously expensive model of college education in the US. And whether there might be a better way of making sure everyone can access a high quality higher education experience.\n\nIt is tempting to say “we should standardize on this and agree that we will all pay for it and make it available to everyone.” How can you argue with that?\n\nAnd yet we know that approach leads to systems that don’t change, don’t adapt, cost too much, fail us, and frustrate us.\n\nThis is the reason I am so drawn to the idea of a universal basic income. I can’t honestly understand how we would structure it, how we make it sustainable, and how we actually all agree to do it. But the idea of spending our money ensuring that everyone has the means to access the essential human needs instead of trying to provide these services makes a lot of sense to me.

Weiss are set to adapt the hit book trilogy for Netflix. The Senators&#8217; accuse the streamer of &#8220;normalizing&#8221; China&#8217;s extra-judicial detention of over one million Muslims in Xinjiang, referencing past comments from the books&#8217; author Liu Cixin supporting the program.\nFact #1: The Three Body Problem book trilogy by Liu Cixin is a fantastic work of art. \nIMO it&#8217;s the most important work of science fiction since Asimov&#8217;s Foundation trilogy back in the 1950s, and I&#8217;m thrilled that Netflix is adapting it into a television/movie series (less thrilled that Benioff and Weiss are the guys in charge).\nFact #2: Liu Cixin is not outspoken on politics, but when he does speak, he is a non-apologetic apologist for the Chinese government&#8217;s brutal treatment of its Uyghur minority population.\nHere&#8217;s the quote that everyone focuses on, from a June, 2019 feature article in the New Yorker:\nWhen I brought up the mass internment of Muslim&#160;Uighurs&#8212;around a million are now in re-education camps in the northwestern province of Xinjiang&#8212;he trotted out the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: &#8220;Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty.&#8221; The answer duplicated government propaganda so exactly that I couldn&#8217;t help asking Liu if he ever thought he might have been brainwashed. &#8220;I know what you are thinking,&#8221; he told me with weary clarity. &#8220;What about individual liberty and freedom of governance?&#8221; He sighed, as if exhausted by a debate going on in his head. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not what Chinese people care about. For ordinary folks, it&#8217;s the cost of health care, real-estate prices, their children&#8217;s education. Not democracy.&#8221;\nFact #3: Yesterday, five GOP Senators sent a letter to Netflix, saying that any adaptation of Liu Cixin&#8217;s work amounted to &#8220;normalization&#8221; of China&#8217;s actions against the Uyghurs, and that &#8220;Netflix&#8217;s decision to do business with an individual who is parroting dangerous CCP propaganda&#8221; amounts to &#8220;complicity&#8221; with the CCP.\nYou can download a PDF copy of the letter here.\nThe surface issue around these facts, of course, is whether artists are separable from their art.\nDoes the recognition and promotion of good art made by artists with abhorrent political opinions serve also to recognize and promote those abhorrent political opinions?\nMy answer is yes &#8230; if you&#8217;re a rhinoceros.\nBut if you&#8217;re still a human being &#8230; if you&#8217;re still able to hold two independent thoughts in your head at the same time &#8230; if you&#8217;re still able to believe that yes, China&#8217;s treatment of the Uyghurs is a grotesque evil deserving of implacable sanction and resistance AND yes, The Three Body Problem is an important work of art &#8230; then my answer is no.\nTo be sure, there is a spectrum of association between artist and abhorrent regime that plays a crucial role in how I&#8217;m answering this question. I mean, no one needs to be doing a Leni Riefenstahl retrospective in 1938. That said, I don&#8217;t think that any reasonable person could say that Liu Cixin is an unofficial spokesperson for the Chinese government like Riefenstahl was for Germany, and I definitely don&#8217;t think that any reasonable person could say that The Three Body Problem is a glorification of the grotesque Chinese state like Triumph of the Will was a glorification of the grotesque German state.\nIt is, of course, possible for well-meaning people to disagree on this question.\nBut I don&#8217;t think that the five GOP Senators who sent this letter to Netflix are well-meaning.\nI don&#8217;t think these Senators care very much about this book adaptation and the indirect-at-best &#8220;normalization&#8221; of abhorrent political views held by the author of the source material.

We are open to discussing lower or higher amounts, and the funds can be pooled from multiple sources.\nBoth sides will agree in advance on the specifics of how a winner is determined, and what arbitration mechanism to use, if need be.\nThe challenger needs to declare that they do not have access to any relevant non-public information. This is to protect from abuse in case of unpublished research (there is still a small chance that further research will discover the treatment is ineffective). For the same reason, we may update these terms or withdraw the offer, as new information emerges.\n\n\nRootclaim is putting a lot of weight on their analysis of this study.

Hopes are high that answers about at least one candidate being tested in the U.S. could come by year's end, maybe sooner.\nU.S. health officials insist the race for a vaccine isn't cutting corners.\n&quot;We want to do everything we can without sacrificing safety or efficacy - we're not going to do that - to make sure that we end up with vaccines that are going to save lives,&quot; Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told reporters.\nBut many vaccine specialists question whether the Food and Drug Administration will stick to that goal under intense pressure from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has consistently presented a faster timeline for a new vaccine than experts say is adequate to fully test the candidates.\nRELATED | Majority of Americans report no confidence in Trump when it comes to safety of COVID-19 vaccine \nMeanwhile, testing of still another experimental vaccine, made by AstraZeneca, remains on hold in the U.S. as officials examine a safety question, even though studies have resumed in other countries.\nEarlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence urged state governors to &quot;do your part to build public confidence that it will be a safe and effective vaccine.&quot;\nAnd Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, added in the call to governors that he is confident in &quot;a tried and true process&quot; that has checks and balances built in, including an independent board evaluating the progress of each vaccine trial, as well as &quot;the integrity of the FDA.&quot;\nA recording of the call was provided to The Associated Press.\nSenators were scheduled to question FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, Fauci and other administration officials later Wednesday about the pandemic response.\n\nEven if the FDA were to allow emergency use of a vaccine by year's end, supplies would be limited and given first to vulnerable groups such as health workers. Most Americans aren't likely to receive a vaccine until sometime next year.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants states to get ready now to roll out vaccinations, which will present enormous logistical challenges. On Wednesday the CDC was set to announce distribution of $200 million in congressionally approved funds to help begin setting up operations.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the COVID-19 vaccine campaign will build on longstanding cooperation between the federal government and the states on immunizations.\nJ&amp;J's vaccine is made with a slightly different technology than others in late-stage testing, modeled on an Ebola vaccine the company created. Unlike the other three vaccines that started late-stage testing in the U.S., it requires only one shot, not two. Despite a later start to testing than some of its competitors, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&amp;J's chief scientific officer, told reporters that the study was large enough to yield answers possibly by early next year. \nCopyright © 2020 by The Associated Press.

The larger SCU and LNU complexes to the east and north are both 98-percent contained, and will hopefully be fully contained before some possible winds kick up this weekend.\nThe CZU Lightning Complex began on August 16 and burned through a large swath of wilderness east of Pescadero in San Mateo County, and down through the Santa Cruz Mountains. Notably, the history Big Basin Redwoods State Park sustained significant damage, particularly to its campgrounds and historic visitors' center. Most of the ancient, fire-resistant redwood grove, however, survived and two of the oldest, tallest trees in the park made it through just fine.\nDespite being the smallest of the three Bay Area fire complexes sparked in the same spate of lightning storms in mid-August, the CZU Lightning Complex was equally as destructive as the LNU Complex in Napa, Sonoma, and Solano counties — both fires destroyed 1,490 structures, and the CZU fires destroyed more single-family homes overall, with 925 destroyed in the final damage assessment, compared to around 750 in the LNU Complex.\nAt the peak of evacuation orders in the CZU Complex, some 77,000 residents were displaced from their homes. As the Mercury News reports, about 1,000 people remained displaced as of Tuesday.\nFire danger from these fire zones does not fully disappear with containment, however.\n&quot;Remember, contained is not controlled,” says the Cal Fire CZU (San Mateo-Santa Cruz) Unit in a tweet. “We will continue to monitor this fire for smoldering areas.&quot;\n#CZULightningComplex is 100% contained.

That fire, which began with the other lightning complex fires but flared up again on September 7, claimed at least 15 lives, most of them in the small wooded town of Berry Creek — and the stories of those who failed to evacuate in time bring with them tragic echoes of the Camp Fire two years ago, which occurred just about 20 miles to the northwest. The North Complex is currently 75-percent contained.\nSuch flare-ups and new spread of these weeks-old fires are the nightmare scenario the Bay Area wants desperately to avoid — and the scenario that Cal Fire doesn't want to see repeated in the North Complex. \nSimilarly high winds are due to hit Northern California this Saturday, September 26, which could spell disaster in any number of areas where fires are still burning or smoldering, including within the perimeter of the August Complex Fire to the north.

By moving vast quantities of water and suppressing wildfires for decades, the state has transformed its arid and mountainous landscape into the richest, most populous and bounteous place in the nation.\nBut now, those same feats have given California a new and unwelcome category of superlatives.\nThis year is the state&#8217;s worst wildfire season on record. That follows its hottest August on record; a punishing drought that lasted from 2011 to last year; and one of its worst flood emergencies on record three years ago, when heavy rains caused the state&#8217;s highest dam to nearly fail, forcing more than 180,000 people to flee.\nThe same manufactured landscapes that have enabled California&#8217;s tremendous growth, building the state into a $3 trillion economy that is home to one in 10 Americans, have also left it more exposed to climate shocks, experts say.\nAnd those shocks will only get worse.\n&#8220;There&#8217;s sort of this sense that we can bend the world to our will,&#8221; said Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist in San Francisco for the Union of Concerned Scientists. &#8220;Climate change is exposing the vulnerabilities in the systems that we&#8217;ve engineered.&#8221;\nThose systems include some of the greatest accomplishments in American public infrastructure: Transporting huge amounts of water from the mountains to the coast and from north to south. Creating almost 1,500 reservoirs to store that water until it&#8217;s needed. Subduing the fires that are part of forest ecosystems, making more land livable for millions but stocking those forests with fuel in the process. Building dense cities along a shoreline susceptible to erosion and flooding.\nThose accomplishments reflect the optimism that defines California, according to R. Jisung Park, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, who focuses on climate adaptation. But like so much that underpins modern American life, they weren&#8217;t designed to accommodate the increasingly harsh extremes of climate change.\n&#8220;The shocks are outside the range, in many cases, of historical experience,&#8221; Dr. Park said. And in a heavily manufactured system, he added, the consequences of those shocks can become more dire.\nImageFire retardant on a ridge at the Angeles National Forest near Monrovia, Calif., this month.Credit...David Mcnew/Getty ImagesImageSmoke shrouded Juniper Hills, northeast of Los Angeles, on Thursday.&#160;This year is California&#8217;s worst wildfire season on record.Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York TimesImageA strawberry picker  in the Central Valley&#160;during a heat wave last month.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesDr. Park, like other experts interviewed, noted that California&#8217;s engineered landscapes are not the only factor behind its high-impact disasters. The state&#8217;s size and geographic diversity expose it to an unusually wide range of extreme climate events. And its large population means that when disasters do strike, they are very likely to affect large numbers of people.\nStill, the manufactured systems that support the state&#8217;s population and economy have left the state especially vulnerable. The wildfires are only the latest example of how climate change can cause engineered landscapes to go awry. Those blazes are partly the result of hotter temperatures and drier conditions, scientists say, which have made it easier for vegetation to ignite, causing fires to become bigger and more intense.\nBut the intensity of those fires also reflects decades of policy decisions that altered those forests, according to Robert Bonnie, who oversaw the United States Forest Service under President Barack Obama. And the cost of those decisions is now coming due.\nIn an effort to protect homes and encourage new building, governments for decades focused on suppressing fires that occurred naturally, allowing the buildup of vegetation that would provide fuel for future blazes. Even after the drawbacks of that approach became clear, officials remained reluctant to reduce that vegetation through prescribed burns, wary of upsetting residents with smoke or starting a fire that might burn out of control.\nThat approach made California&#8217;s forests more comfortable for the estimated 11 million people who now live in and around them. But it has also made them more susceptible to catastrophic fires. &#8220;We&#8217;ve sort of built up this fire debt,&#8221; Mr. Bonnie said. &#8220;People are going to have to tolerate smoke and risk.&#8221;\nPresident Trump, apparently referring to the increase in vegetation, has responded to California&#8217;s fires by telling the state to &#8220;clean your floors.&#8221; But most of the forests in California are federally owned, Mr. Bonnie noted, and Mr. Trump has sought to cut spending on forest management. And Mr. Bonnie said the fuels that matter most aren&#8217;t on the forest floor, but rather the trees themselves &#8212; and the best solution is letting more of them burn safely.\nAnother example of California&#8217;s engineered landscape is the sprawling system of transporting and storing water. Three-quarters of the state&#8217;s precipitation falls north of Sacramento, according to Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. But three-quarters of the state&#8217;s water use is south of Sacramento.\n&#8220;The vast majority of our people are concentrated in the areas where the water is not,&#8221; Dr. Mount said. California&#8217;s response was to build what he called &#8220;by far the West&#8217;s most complicated storage and conveyance system.&#8221;\nThat system moves water that falls as snow on the Sierra Nevada mountains to the south and west, providing drinking water for the state&#8217;s coastal cities and irrigation for farms in the arid Central Valley, turning California into an agricultural powerhouse that produces one-quarter of the nation&#8217;s food.\nClimate change is now shaking that system.\nImageWater rushed out of the Oroville Dam&#160;in 2017 after part of the structure collapsed.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesImageSeal Beach, south of Los Angeles, in February 2019 after storms flushed garbage and debris into rivers and drains and out to sea.Credit...Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register, via Associated PressImageThe Folsom South Canal, part of the system of aqueducts that moves water in California.Credit...Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesPrecipitation patterns are becoming more extreme: The dry years are becoming drier, forcing cities and farmers to deplete their underground aquifers &#8212; something that Frances C. Moore, an assistant professor of environmental economics and climate science at the University of California, Davis, called a &#8220;race to the bottom.&#8221;\n&#8220;That is not something that&#8217;s a sustainable response,&#8221; Dr. Moore said.\nAt the same time, wet periods are becoming wetter, which brings challenges of its own. Heavy rains threaten to overwhelm the vast network of aqueducts, reservoirs and dams that hold that water.\nThat increases the likelihood of the sort of catastrophe that almost struck three years ago, Dr. Mount said. A combination of intense rain and structural damage nearly caused the failure of the Oroville Dam, the nation&#8217;s highest, which would have unleashed disastrous flooding north of Sacramento.\nWildfires in the West &#8250;Live UpdatesUpdated&#160;Sept. 18, 2020, 11:10 p.m. ETA firefighter has died battling a fire ignited during a gender-reveal party.Evacuations are ordered as a fire spreads near Palm Springs.Yosemite is closing as the West chokes under smoky skies.Oroville is unlikely to be a one-off event. California has more dams rated &#8220;high hazard&#8221; than almost any other state, according to figures from the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. California&#8217;s state auditor reported in January that while the state has upgraded the Oroville Dam, others around California continue to pose a risk.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re got 40 million people who are dependent on this system, which was designed in the last century,&#8221; Dr. Mount said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a surprise that you&#8217;re seeing many crises.&#8221;\nClimate change is also threatening California&#8217;s coastline, the longest in the nation after Alaska and Florida. That coastline is less physically exposed to rising seas than parts of the Atlantic, where water levels are rising more quickly, according to Dr. Dahl at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nBut California&#8217;s more densely populated coast, combined with its use of landfill to expand waterfront communities and its famous cliff-side homes, mean the state has more people at jeopardy from rising seas.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve built right to the edge of the water,&#8221; Dr. Dahl said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve altered the coastline to suit our needs, and we&#8217;re increasingly seeing the limitations of that.&#8221;\nImageThe Dollaradio station in Pacifica last year.

I&#8217;m fifth-generation.&#8221;\nThat optimism is shared, perhaps unsurprisingly, by state officials. Kate Gordon, a senior climate adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom, described a series of steps the state is taking to cope with climate risks, including shifting more development into cities and away from the edge of the wilderness, and designing coastal roads and bridges with rising seas in mind.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve allowed for a development pattern that&#8217;s completely sprawled, which I don&#8217;t think we can keep doing,&#8221; Ms. Gordon said. &#8220;We have a lot of ability to be more compact, to be more efficient.&#8221;\nOthers were more wary. Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley and co-director of the university&#8217;s Climate Impact Lab, described being stuck inside as smoke filled the sky, and walking around his home with a hand-held air-quality indicator to find out which rooms had the worst air. &#8220;Everyone who could leave town has left town,&#8221; he said.\nClimate change in California is more than just an escalating series of short- and long-term disasters, Dr. Hsiang said. It&#8217;s also eroding the idea that the state can mold itself into whatever it wants to be, insulated from the physical threats around it.\n&#8220;California was the land of opportunities,&#8221; Dr. Hsiang added. &#8220;There&#8217;s this story that we can have it all, and that&#8217;s just not true.&#8221;\n","title":"How California Became Ground Zero for Climate Disasters","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/climate/california-climate-disasters.html","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1600447785,"author":"SocketSite","dateadded":"2020-09-18 15:03:31","comment":"Bay Area unemployment down 400k from a year ago\n","excerpt":"While the estimated number of people living in San Francisco with a paycheck increased by 5,900 in August to 515,900, the labor force shrank by 7,800 to 565,700 for an unemployment rate of 8.8 percent (versus 9.4 percent at the height of the Great Recession).

I originally intended to publish this post earlier in the year to coincide with our paper release, but due to the unprecedented and ongoing California wildfire crisis during Aug-Sep 2020 I decided to wait until a relatively calmer window.\n\n\nCalifornia is no stranger to wildfire&#8212;but the stakes are increasing\n\nWildfire has been a part of the landscape in the region encompassed by present-day California since&#8230;well, time immemorial. Fire is a natural process, and many ecosystems depend on fire of some frequency and intensity for their health and long-term regeneration (although natural fire frequency and intensity varies widely across different ecoregions and vegetation types). Indeed, the indigenous peoples of California have actively managed fire for over 10,000 years&#8212;so even human interaction with California wildfire is nothing new.\n\nBut several hundred years ago, California was home to fewer than half a million people. Today, more than 40 million live in the Golden State&#8212;millions of whom live in &#8220;high hazard&#8221; fire risk zones. At the same time that many California communities have expanded into potential harm&#8217;s way in the wildland urban interface, the unfortunate legacy of 20th century &#8220;total fire suppression&#8221; policies has allowed forests to become unnaturally overcrowded in many places, increasing potential flammability. (This is, in fact, a significant problem throughout heavily forested parts of the American West. But, importantly, it&#8217;s also largely essentially irrelevant with respect to the relatively large subset of California wildfires that occur outside of its forested regions&#8211;such as in coastal chaparral or oak woodland regimes.)\n\n\nBoth of these influences&#8212;the expansion of communities into the wildlands and historical fire suppression increasing forest fuel loads&#8212;have clearly increased the risk of large and destructive California wildfires. But these two important factors, on their own, don&#8217;t tell the whole story. California&#8217;s warming climate is another critical piece of the increasingly complex puzzle, and is acting as a &#8220;wildfire threat multiplier&#8221; spanning geographies and fire regimes. But how, exactly, can we isolate and quantify the climate change component of California&#8217;s rapidly escalating wildfire problem? That was the question we set out to answer in the study I discuss in this blog post.\n\n\nThe context: devastating autumn firestorms in 2017 and 2018\nThe events of autumn 2017 and 2018 are deeply etched in the memory of many Californians (although some of these memories have already been eclipsed by even more recent and widespread fire catastrophes in 2020). The Camp Fire&#8211;which destroyed most of the town of Paradise, CA in the northern Sierra Nevada foothills&#8211;and the Woolsey Fire in the Santa Monica Mountains in coastal southern California together claimed around 90 lives and 20,000 structures as they burned simultaneously on November 8, 2018. Just one year earlier, on October 8 2017, the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa and other nearby conflagrations claimed over 25 lives and 6,000 structures. These were&#8212;and remain&#8212;stunning and tragic wildfire losses on a scale that had not previously been experienced in California.\n\nThe ambient weather and climate conditions preceding each of these fires were strikingly similar: record vegetation dryness, following extremely warm conditions in the weeks and months preceding the fires, coincided with a strong offshore wind event. Such offshore wind events are not uncommon in California during the autumn, and indeed have historically been associated with a large majority of the regions fastest-moving and most destructive wildfires historically. But what was different this time, compared to previous major wind-driven autumn fires over the past century, was the extreme and in many cases record-breaking level of vegetation dryness leading up to the wind events. (It is worth noting that a somewhat similar set of conditions has once again led to an unprecedented wildfire crisis in California as of this writing&#8212;especially with respect to the fast-spreading Bear/North Complex fire in Butte County, which has thus far been the deadliest of the fires so far during the 2020 fire siege).\n\nThe horrifying details of the California wildfire situation over these past few years&#8212;particularly in autumn&#8212;thus motivated us to formally and scientifically address the question that was on everyone&#8217;s mind: is climate change contributing to California&#8217;s escalating wildfire crisis?\n\n\nExtreme autumn wildfire conditions have more than doubled\nObserved increase in autumn extreme fire weather days in California (over 1979-2018, the full length of the satellite record at the time of publication). (Goss et al. 2020)As it turns out, the short answer is&#8230;yes: we found that climate change has already more than doubled the frequency of extreme autumn wildfire conditions in California over the past ~40 years. This finding is based on observed changes in the frequency of occurrence of autumn days exceeding the 95th percentile of the historical Fire Weather Index (FWI). The FWI gives a quantitative estimate of the severity of wildfire risk using a multivariate suite of meteorological data (including temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and vegetation &#8220;fuel moisture&#8221; (which itself incorporates antecedent weather/climate information)). Overall, mean September-November FWI in California increased by about 20% between 1980 and 2018&#8212;a trend that was distributed fairly uniformly across the state, including both coastal and interior regions in the north and south. We further found that the occurrence of extreme FWI days was strongly associated with days on which large wildfires occurred&#8212;strengthening the link between increasing FWI and the severity of actual fire conditions on the ground.\n\n\nHotter temperatures and reduced autumn precipitation\nObserved trends in autumn (September-November) temperature, precipitation, and Fire Weather Index in California (1979-2018).This large increase in both mean and extreme fire weather conditions was driven by a combination of warming temperature (around +1.6 F) and decreased precipitation (around -30%) during autumn. These observed trends in temperature and precipitation, as with FWI, occurred across virtually all of California over the study period. The effect of warming is almost exactly as you&#8217;d expect&#8212;warmer temperatures equal higher fire risk&#8212;but I discuss why the magnitude of that effect is larger than most folks might realize in the next section. The role of decreased autumn precipitation is a bit more complicated, though, and is worth some additional consideration.\n\nMost of California sees the vast majority of its seasonal precipitation during its core rainy season months in winter (i.e., December-March). The first widespread soaking rainfall historically arrived in northern California in October or November, and in southern California slightly later&#8211;during November or December. As a result, autumn precipitation is (even in the best of years) typically only a modest fraction of what falls during the core rainy season months. But as many Californians may intuitively understand, autumn precipitation is of outsized importance from a wildfire perspective. This is because the onset of &#8220;fire season-ending rains&#8221; typically occurs sometime during the fall, and once widespread soaking precipitation arrives, fire season is effectively over. From a wildfire risk perspective, the earlier this occurs, the better&#8212;since autumn also happens to be the season during desiccating &#8220;offshore winds&#8221; begin to occur. These very dry, sometimes violent downsloping wind events&#8212;known as the Santa Ana winds in southern California and the Diablo winds around the San Francisco Bay Area&#8212;typically begin around late September before peaking in late autumn or early winter. If the autumn rains are minimal, or are delayed, the temporal overlap between &#8220;summer-like&#8221; vegetation dryness and offshore wind season increases&#8212;a dangerous combination that can lead to extremely high FWI and subsequent wildfire risk.\n\nThis potentially explosive combination of increasingly warm and dry autumns is something we&#8217;ve been seeing more often in recent decades, and it has driven a pretty dramatic increase in extreme fire weather days between September and November&#8212;just as we saw in autumn 2017/2018 (and as now may be occurring again during autumn 2020). And this is all happening without a clear increase in the offshore winds themselves! The key climate connection&#8211;as I discuss in greater detail below&#8211;is through warming, drying, and the increasing aridity of California&#8217;s vegetation.\n\n\nClimate change is cause of observed increase in extreme fire weather\nProjected change in extreme fire weather days during autumn in northern California (left) and southern California (right) under a medium warming (blue curve) and high warming (red curve) scenario. (Goss et al. 2020)Historical data using real-world observations clearly showing that autumn warming and drying have increase extreme fire weather conditions in California over the past 40 years. But are these observed trends directly attributable to long-term climate change caused by human activities? That was the next question we set out to answer in our study using a suite of climate model simulations, which allow us to assess whether the observed increase in extreme autumn fire weather conditions in California are consistent with what would have been predicted. And the answer, once again, is yes: the observed increase in extreme fire weather conditions in California during autumn over the past few decades is exactly what climate models suggest should have happened due to human-caused climate change over the same period.\n\n\nKey climate-wildfire link is through vegetation aridity\nOne thing that has become quite clear in recent years, both in our own work and in the increasingly extensive body of scientific inquiry by other researchers, is that the primary link between climate change and wildfire risk is through vegetation aridity. All else being equal, when vegetation of any type loses moisture and becomes drier, it burns more readily and more intensely. It&#8217;s not simply a question of whether vegetation is &#8220;dry enough to burn&#8221;&#8212;in California during the summer and autumn months, there&#8217;s no question that it usually is. Instead, it is literally a matter of degrees, since the magnitude of vegetation dryness has long been known to strongly modulate the characteristics of wildfire&#8212;and increasingly dry vegetation is associated with hotter, faster-burning, and more extremely &#8220;behaving&#8221; fires. As fire intensity, severity, and size increases with vegetation aridity, these fires become more dangerous to humans and more detrimental to ecosystems.\n\n\nHow, exactly, does climate change increase vegetation aridity? Well, the basic effect is actually fairly intuitive&#8212;warmer air means more evaporation, which means less water available to plants in the absence of a large increase in precipitation to close the water balance. But the details are pretty interesting, if you bear with me for a moment.\n\nRising temperatures increase what&#8217;s known as the &#8220;vapor pressure deficit&#8221; (VPD). The VPD is essentially a measure of the propensity for the atmosphere to act as a giant sponge and to &#8220;demand&#8221; water, via evaporation and/or transpiration, from the land surface and from plants. VPD is defined as the difference (in absolute terms) between how much water vapor could be in the atmosphere (i.e., the &#8220;saturation vapor pressure&#8221;) and how much water is actually in the atmosphere at a particular point in time. Because the saturation vapor pressure increases exponentially for linear increases in temperature, the VPD can increase quite quickly as temperatures rise&#8212;even if the relative humidity stays the same! The higher the VPD, the greater the degree of &#8220;atmospheric thirstiness&#8221;&#8212;which dries out both living and dead vegetation that acts as wildfire fuel. (Robinson Meyer, in his recent piece, includes a great overview of VPD in the context of wildfire and climate change).\n\nTheoretical, model-derived, and real-world observational evidence all agree that the VPD is increasing in California in a warming climate&#8212;and that this is directly related to the surge in extremely large and intense wildfires. This is unfortunately being borne out in real time: the observed VPD reached record high levels in the days leading up to the unprecedented summer/autumn 2020 wildfire siege in California.\n\n\nWhat does the future hold? More warming, and further increases in wildfire risk\nProjected changes in extreme fire weather days during autumn under a &#8220;medium warming&#8221; (left column) and &#8220;high warming&#8221; scenario (right column). (Goss et al. 2020)In short: we find that the greater the magnitude of global warming, the greater the degree of increased wildfire risk in California. In this study, we considered two possible future warming trajectories: one roughly approximating a world in which there is strict adherence to the 2016 Paris Agreement emissions targets and one outlining a &#8220;high emissions&#8221; future where global carbon emissions continue to increase rapidly and/or strong carbon cycle feedbacks occur. (For perspective, we&#8217;re currently on a path somewhere in between these two trajectories.) In both scenarios, the occurrence of extreme autumn fire weather conditions continues to increase for much of the 21st century&#8212;but at a substantially greater rate in the &#8220;high warming scenario.&#8221; In some fire risk hotspots in the Sierra Nevada and in the foothills ringing the Central Valley, we project a future increase that is anywhere from 50-150% above the historical 20th century baseline risk. Other areas&#8212;especially places closer to the coast&#8212;see smaller, though still substantial, increases in extreme autumn fire risk. (It&#8217;s also worth noting that the recent observed trend in extreme fire weather conditions over the past several decades has been even faster than climate models had suggested for the same period&#8212;so it is possible that current simulations may yet be underestimating future climate-linked wildfire risk.)\n\nOne thing that was particularly striking to me and other co-authors was the spatial ubiquity of these projected future wildfire risk increases across California&#8212;they appear to transcend geographies, ecosystems, and fire regimes. As such, this represents an even stronger statement regarding climate change and California wildfire risk than previous studies&#8212;which found a strong influence primarily in forested regions. On the other hand: an important caveat is that our study does not account for changes in the vegetation distribution itself&#8212;and previous work has shown that substantial climate-fire-vegetation feedbacks may emerge in the coming years that could either mitigate (or amplify) these climate-caused trends (depending on the local context). Needless to say, there will be much more research to come given the magnitude of the changes we&#8217;ve already observed, and those still to come.\n\n\nWhat can be done? My personal perspective on global, community, and landscape-scale interventions\nAs much as we all wish there was a &#8220;silver bullet&#8221; solution to the rapidly escalating wildfire crisis in California and beyond, all available evidence suggests that there&#8217;s no simple way out. Wildfire is an inherently complex biogeochemical process, and there is no singular reason for the worsening crisis. It&#8217;s not just climate change, nor simply the unfortunate legacy of 20th century forest management, nor only the continued expansion into the wildland urban interface&#8212;it really is all of these things together, all at once.\n\nFor this reason, it makes sense to tackle each part of the problem separately, and in parallel. Increasing wildfire risk is only one of innumerably many reasons why we urgently need to halt global warming by eventually bringing our collective net carbon emission to near zero&#8212;but this will take a truly global effort, and is not something that&#8217;s going to happen overnight. Regardless of our future carbon emission trajectory, there is going to be additional global warming beyond what we&#8217;ve already experienced&#8212;so that component of wildfire risk is almost certainly going to get worse before it gets better. Over the next 10-20 years, at least, we&#8217;re are going to have to learn to live with continually increasing climate-contributed wildfire risk.\n\n\nBut the other two wildfire risk amplifiers&#8212;the legacy of total fire suppression and the increased vulnerability of populated areas to fires&#8212;are both issues that can potentially be addressed at the individual, local, and state level. There is already much ongoing discussion regarding the need to embrace managed and/or prescribed &#8220;good fire&#8221; on a much larger scale than currently implemented to help reduce wildfire fuel loads and improve forest health. Various entities at the local, state, and tribal nation level are working to put these plans into action in the next few years&#8212;although a complicating factor remains the fact that most forest lands in the American West are either privately or federally owned.\n\nMuch can also be done to improve the resilience of communities as well as individual structures to wildfire hazards. While the oft-promoted notion of &#8220;defensible space&#8221; is a good place to start, recent evidence suggests that other interventions are even more effective&#8212;including fire-resilient building materials and methods. At larger scales, communities can be designed to better resist fire (by incorporating greenbelts or fuel-reduction corridors, for example). Improved evacuation planning and communications infrastructure can make worst-case scenario firestorms less deadly by making it easier to leave affected areas in a safe and timely manner. And there has also been progress toward reducing high-risk wildfire ignitions during extreme wind events&#8212;via &#8220;Public Safety Power Shut-Offs&#8221; by electrical utilities&#8212;although such interventions remain highly disruptive, societally inequitable, and probably unsustainable in the long run due to our warming climate.\n\nIn the end, if we want to make meaningful progress toward stemming the exponential tide of wildfire catastrophes in California and the rest of the West, we&#8217;re going to have to take an &#8220;all of the above&#8221; approach. Some of the interventions mentioned above are essentially short-term stopgap measures; other could form the basis of a more sustainable long-term approach. I think one thing on which we can all agree, though, is that the status quo is definitely not working&#8212;and that we urgently need to have a serious conversation regarding how to move forward.\n\n\nHow is this article different from typical Weather West blog posts?\nThis special Weather West article focuses on peer-reviewed scientific research by my colleagues and I that has recently been published in Environmental Research Letters, and also discusses peer-reviewed work by other scientists.

Unadjusted sales should show a smaller YOY increase, reflecting this August’s lower business day count relative to last August’s.\n\nLocal realtor/MLS data suggest that the median US existing single-family home sales price last month was up by a steamy 11.6% from last August, partly boosted by the mix of home sales but mainly boosted by the lack of available inventory across much of the country combined with strong demand for SF detached homes.\n\nWhile not all realtor reports include data on new pending sales – and some that do often revise those data significantly – the limited data available suggest that the YOY increase in pending sales again exceeded the YOY gain in closed sales last month.\n\nProjecting the NAR’s inventory estimate for August is tricky.

However, those same local reports for July would have suggested a much sharply YOY drop in inventories than the NAR reported.\n\n Most of these local realtor/MLS reports utilize third-party software, and most exclude all pending contracts from their inventory number.

The consensus is for 6.00 million SAAR.","title":"Lawler: Early Read on Existing Home Sales in August","url":"https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/09/lawler-early-read-on-existing-home.html","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1600342035,"author":"Tim Ellis","dateadded":"2020-09-17 9:10:08","comment":"SF real estate listings up 75%, sales down 13%","excerpt":"The national median home price rose 11% year over year to $328,400 in August—the largest annual increase since February 2014.\n\nThe post Home Prices Rose 11% in August—Biggest Gain in Over 6 Years appeared first on Redfin | Real Estate Tips for Home Buying, Selling &amp; More.\n","extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"Only two of the 85 largest metros tracked by Redfin posted a year-over-year increase in the count of seasonally-adjusted active listings of homes for sale: San Francisco (+75%) and New York City (+10%).

As has been the case for most of the summer, low mortgage rates drove homebuyer demand, but the supply of homes for sale has fallen to another new low.\n\n“The supply of homes is tighter than ever and home prices are growing at the fastest rate in years. Why isn’t this historic seller’s market holding back buyers?” said Redfin lead economist Taylor Marr. “Homeowners are just now deciding to sell; they were just a little late to the game. These new listings have supplied buyers with homes to purchase. High prices almost always eventually draw sellers to market and with record low rates, trading out your home for a new mortgage can be more attractive than refinancing.”\n\nMedian prices increased in every single one of the 85 largest metro areas Redfin tracks. The smallest increase was in New York (+2.7%). Meanwhile, Bridgeport, CT (+30.7%), Memphis, TN (+20.5%) and Tulsa, OK (+19.8%), saw the largest year-over-year increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Summary\nAugust 2020\nMonth-Over-Month\nYear-Over-Year\n\n\n\n\nMedian sale price\n$328,400\n1.7%\n11.0%\n\n\nHomes sold, seasonally-adjusted\n585,098\n2.2%\n10.2%\n\n\nPending sales, seasonally-adjusted\n573,500\n10.4%\n29.8%\n\n\nNew listings, seasonally-adjusted\n641,900\n2.2%\n4.6%\n\n\nAll Homes for sale, seasonally-adjusted\n1,677,400\n-2.3%\n-22.0%\n\n\nMedian days on market\n31\n-4\n-8\n\n\nMonths of supply\n1.6\n0\n-1\n\n\nSold above list\n32.0%\n2.1 pts†\n8.2 pts†\n\n\nMedian Off-Market Redfin Estimate\n$315,800\n2.1%\n4.4%\n\n\nAverage Sale-to-list\n99.3%\n0.2 pts†\n0.8 pts†\n\n\n\n† – “pts” = percentage point change\nHome sales were up 10.2% in August from a year earlier on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the largest increase in nearly four years.\n\nHome sales increased in August from a year earlier in 56 of the 85 largest metro areas—a slight decrease from July. The largest gains in sales were in Bridgeport, CT (+38.8%), Lake County, IL (+24.5%) and Chicago (+17.1%). The list of markets where sales are falling the most continued to be dominated by New York State, led by Nassau County, NY (-27.5%), Buffalo, NY (-23.7%) and Rochester, NY (-22.6%).\n\n\n\nActive listings—the count of all homes that were for sale at any time during the month—fell 22.0% year over year to their lowest level on record in August, the 12th-straight month of declines. The supply shortage continued to worsen because buyers bought homes at a faster rate than the number of homes being listed. At the same time, a growing share of homes is selling quickly, leaving few homes lingering on the market from one month to the next.\n\n\n\nOnly two of the 85 largest metros tracked by Redfin posted a year-over-year increase in the count of seasonally-adjusted active listings of homes for sale: San Francisco (+75%) and New York City (+10%). The sudden expansion of work-from-home policies due to the pandemic has led many people to flee these cities, two of the country’s most expensive housing markets.\n\nCompared to a year ago, the biggest declines in active housing supply in July were in Allentown, PA (-55.0%), Kansas City, MO (-53.0%) and Salt Lake City (-50.5%).\n\nThe number of new listings of homes for sale increased 4.6% in August from a year earlier, only the third such increase in the past 15 months. Pending sales were up 29.8% from August 2019.\n\n“Some of the growth in homes for sale is fueled by San Francisco and New York, where buyers aren’t as interested right now, but these are the exceptions,” explained Marr. “In Seattle, new listings jumped 35%, fueling a 45% increase in pending sales. The housing market is like a national game of musical chairs right now, where everyone wants to jump in now that remote work and low mortgage rates have changed the rules of the game. But will the music soon stop? Can builders add more chairs if the cost of doing so is skyrocketing?“\n\n\n\nAs a result of the continued imbalance between the number of homebuyers and sellers in the market, measures of competition such as time on market and the share of homes sold above list price trended toward an increasingly competitive market in August, bucking the usual seasonal trend.\n\nThe typical home that sold in August went under contract in 31 days—eight days less than a year earlier. This tied the record low (since at least 2012) that was set in June 2018.\n\n\n\nTypically by this time of year, homes spend more time on the market and the share of homes that sold above list price declines. This year, both of these measures are defying seasonality, moving in the opposite direction from their typical pattern, indicating a seller’s market that is hotter than ever.\n\n“The market took a short break when the pandemic first hit, but over the past few months things have really picked up and just haven’t slowed down,” said Boise Redfin agent Kristin Lopez. “It seems all the West Coasters who considered moving to Idaho all decided they absolutely had to get out here ASAP. Demand has been high, but we’re down to the lowest of the low inventory, which has created a complete storm of insanity.”\n\nIn August 32.0% of homes sold above list price—the highest level in our data, which goes back through 2012—up from 23.8% a year earlier.\n\n\n\n\nOther August Highlights\nCompetition\n\nTacoma, WA was the fastest market, with half of all homes pending sale in just 6 days, down from 13 days a year earlier. Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, MI were the next fastest markets with 7 and 7 median days on market, followed by Seattle (7) and Denver (9).\nThe most competitive market in August was Oakland, CA where 61.9% of homes sold above list price, followed by 58.0% in Rochester, NY, 55.2% in Tacoma, WA, 54.3% in San Jose, CA, and 53.2% in Buffalo, NY.\n\nPrices\n\nBridgeport, CT had the nation’s highest price growth, rising 30.7% since last year to $539,200. Memphis, TN had the second highest growth at 20.5% year-over-year price growth, followed by Tulsa, OK (19.8%), Cincinnati (19.5%), and Dayton, OH (17.7%).\nNo metros saw price declines in August.\n\nSales\n\nBridgeport, CT led the nation in year-over-year sales growth, up 38.8%, followed by Lake County, IL, up 24.5%. Chicago rounded out the top three with sales up 17.1% from a year ago.\nNassau County, NY saw the largest decline in sales since last year, falling 27.5%. Home sales in Buffalo, NY and Rochester, NY declined by 23.7% and 22.6%, respectively.\n\nInventory\n\nSan Francisco had the highest increase in the number of homes for sale, up 75% year over year, followed by New York (10%).\nAllentown, PA had the largest decrease in overall active listings, falling 55% since last August. Kansas City, MO (-53%), Salt Lake City (-50%), and Baton Rouge, LA (-43%) also saw far fewer homes available on the market than a year ago.\n\nRedfin Estimate\n\nMiami (88.9%) had the largest share of homes predicted to sell for below list price, according to Redfin Estimate data, followed by West Palm Beach, FL (86.3%) and Fort Lauderdale, FL (85.0%).\nOakland, CA (91.2%) had the largest share of homes predicted to sell at or above list price, followed by San Jose, CA (88.7%) and San Francisco (84.7%).\n\nBelow are market-by-market breakdowns for prices, inventory, new listings and sales for markets with populations of 750,000 or more.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.\n\n\n\nThis article, the second in a series on global migration caused by climate change, is a result of a partnership between ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine, with support from the Pulitzer Center.\n\n\n\nAugust besieged California with a heat unseen in generations. A surge in air conditioning broke the state’s electrical grid, leaving a population already ravaged by the coronavirus to work remotely by the dim light of their cellphones. By midmonth, the state had recorded possibly the hottest temperature ever measured on earth — 130 degrees in Death Valley — and an otherworldly storm of lightning had cracked open the sky. From Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe, thousands of bolts of electricity exploded down onto withered grasslands and forests, some of them already hollowed out by climate-driven infestations of beetles and kiln-dried by the worst five-year drought on record. Soon, California was on fire.\n\nOver the next two weeks, 900 blazes incinerated six times as much land as all the state’s 2019 wildfires combined, forcing 100,000 people from their homes. Three of the largest fires in history burned simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. Another fire burned just 12 miles from my home in Marin County. I watched as towering plumes of smoke billowed from distant hills in all directions and air tankers crisscrossed the skies. Like many Californians, I spent those weeks worrying about what might happen next, wondering how long it would be before an inferno of 60-foot flames swept up the steep, grassy hillside on its way toward my own house, rehearsing in my mind what my family would do to escape.\n\nBut I also had a longer-term question, about what would happen once this unprecedented fire season ended. Was it finally time to leave for good?\n\nI had an unusual perspective on the matter. For two years, I have been studying how climate change will influence global migration. My sense was that of all the devastating consequences of a warming planet — changing landscapes, pandemics, mass extinctions — the potential movement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees across the planet stands to be among the most important. I traveled across four countries to witness how rising temperatures were driving climate refugees away from some of the poorest and hottest parts of the world. I had also helped create an enormous computer simulation to analyze how global demographics might shift, and now I was working on a data-mapping project about migration here in the United States.\n\nSo it was with some sense of recognition that I faced the fires these last few weeks. In recent years, summer has brought a season of fear to California, with ever-worsening wildfires closing in. But this year felt different. The hopelessness of the pattern was now clear, and the pandemic had already uprooted so many Americans. Relocation no longer seemed like such a distant prospect. Like the subjects of my reporting, climate change had found me, its indiscriminate forces erasing all semblance of normalcy. Suddenly I had to ask myself the very question I’d been asking others: Was it time to move?\n\nFirefighter Zach Leisure working to contain the Ranch 2 Fire near Azusa last month.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nI am far from the only American facing such questions. This summer has seen more fires, more heat, more storms — all of it making life increasingly untenable in larger areas of the nation. Already, droughts regularly threaten food crops across the West, while destructive floods inundate towns and fields from the Dakotas to Maryland, collapsing dams in Michigan and raising the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Rising seas and increasingly violent hurricanes are making thousands of miles of American shoreline nearly uninhabitable. As California burned, Hurricane Laura pounded the Louisiana coast with 150-mile-an-hour winds, killing at least 25 people; it was the 12th named storm to form by that point in 2020, another record. Phoenix, meanwhile, endured 53 days of 110-degree heat — 20 more days than the previous record.\n\nFor years, Americans have avoided confronting these changes in their own backyards. The decisions we make about where to live are distorted not just by politics that play down climate risks, but also by expensive subsidies and incentives aimed at defying nature. In much of the developing world, vulnerable people will attempt to flee the emerging perils of global warming, seeking cooler temperatures, more fresh water and safety. But here in the United States, people have largely gravitated toward environmental danger, building along coastlines from New Jersey to Florida and settling across the cloudless deserts of the Southwest.\n\nI wanted to know if this was beginning to change. Might Americans finally be waking up to how climate is about to transform their lives? And if so — if a great domestic relocation might be in the offing — was it possible to project where we might go? To answer these questions, I interviewed more than four dozen experts: economists and demographers, climate scientists and insurance executives, architects and urban planners, and ProPublica mapped out the danger zones that will close in on Americans over the next 30 years. The maps for the first time combined exclusive climate data from the Rhodium Group, an independent data-analytics firm; wildfire projections modeled by United States Forest Service researchers and others; and data about America’s shifting climate niches, an evolution of work first published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last spring. (A detailed analysis of the maps is available here.)\n\nWhat I found was a nation on the cusp of a great transformation. Across the United States, some 162 million people — nearly 1 in 2 — will most likely experience a decline in the quality of their environment, namely more heat and less water. For 93 million of them, the changes could be particularly severe, and by 2070, our analysis suggests, if carbon emissions rise at extreme levels, at least 4 million Americans could find themselves living at the fringe, in places decidedly outside the ideal niche for human life. The cost of resisting the new climate reality is mounting. Florida officials have already acknowledged that defending some roadways against the sea will be unaffordable. And the nation’s federal flood-insurance program is for the first time requiring that some of its payouts be used to retreat from climate threats across the country. It will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo.\n\nResidents of Azusa watching the Ranch 2 Fire.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nThen what? One influential 2018 study, published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, suggests that 1 in 12 Americans in the Southern half of the country will move toward California, the Mountain West or the Northwest over the next 45 years because of climate influences alone. Such a shift in population is likely to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor. It will accelerate rapid, perhaps chaotic, urbanization of cities ill-equipped for the burden, testing their capacity to provide basic services and amplifying existing inequities. It will eat away at prosperity, dealing repeated economic blows to coastal, rural and Southern regions, which could in turn push entire communities to the brink of collapse. This process has already begun in rural Louisiana and coastal Georgia, where low-income and Black and Indigenous communities face environmental change on top of poor health and extreme poverty. Mobility itself, global-migration experts point out, is often a reflection of relative wealth, and as some move, many others will be left behind. Those who stay risk becoming trapped as the land and the society around them ceases to offer any more support.\n\nThere are signs that the message is breaking through. Half of Americans now rank climate as a top political priority, up from roughly one-third in 2016, and 3 out of 4 now describe climate change as either “a crisis” or “a major problem.” This year, Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, where tens of thousands of acres of farmland flooded in 2019, ranked climate second only to health care as an issue. A poll by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities found that even Republicans’ views are shifting: 1 in 3 now thinks climate change should be declared a national emergency.\n\nPolicymakers, having left America unprepared for what’s next, now face brutal choices about which communities to save — often at exorbitant costs — and which to sacrifice. Their decisions will almost inevitably make the nation more divided, with those worst off relegated to a nightmare future in which they are left to fend for themselves. Nor will these disruptions wait for the worst environmental changes to occur. The wave begins when individual perception of risk starts to shift, when the environmental threat reaches past the least fortunate and rattles the physical and financial security of broader, wealthier parts of the population. It begins when even places like California’s suburbs are no longer safe.\n\nIt has already begun.\n\nPedro Delgado harvesting a cob of blue corn that grew without kernels at Ramona Farms in Pinal County, Arizona, last month.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nLet’s start with some basics. Across the country, it’s going to get hot. Buffalo, New York, may feel in a few decades like Tempe, Arizona, does today, and Tempe itself will sustain 100-degree average summer temperatures by the end of the century. Extreme humidity from New Orleans to northern Wisconsin will make summers increasingly unbearable, turning otherwise seemingly survivable heat waves into debilitating health threats. Fresh water will also be in short supply, not only in the West but also in places like Florida, Georgia and Alabama, where droughts now regularly wither cotton fields. By 2040, according to federal government projections, extreme water shortages will be nearly ubiquitous west of Missouri. The Memphis Sands Aquifer, a crucial water supply for Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana, is already overdrawn by hundreds of millions of gallons a day. Much of the Ogallala Aquifer — which supplies nearly a third of the nation’s irrigation groundwater — could be gone by the end of the century.\n\nIt can be difficult to see the challenges clearly because so many factors are in play. At least 28 million Americans are likely to face megafires like the ones we are now seeing in California, in places like Texas and Florida and Georgia. At the same time, 100 million Americans — largely in the Mississippi River Basin from Louisiana to Wisconsin — will increasingly face humidity so extreme that working outside or playing school sports could cause heatstroke. Crop yields will be decimated from Texas to Alabama and all the way north through Oklahoma and Kansas and into Nebraska.\n\nThe challenges are so widespread and so interrelated that Americans seeking to flee one could well run into another. I live on a hilltop, 400 feet above sea level, and my home will never be touched by rising waters. But by the end of this century, if the more extreme projections of 8 to 10 feet of sea-level rise come to fruition, the shoreline of San Francisco Bay will move 3 miles closer to my house, as it subsumes some 166 square miles of land, including a high school, a new county hospital and the store where I buy groceries. The freeway to San Francisco will need to be raised, and to the east, a new bridge will be required to connect the community of Point Richmond to the city of Berkeley. The Latino, Asian and Black communities who live in the most-vulnerable low-lying districts will be displaced first, but research from Mathew Hauer, a sociologist at Florida State University who published some of the first modeling of American climate migration in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2017, suggests that the toll will eventually be far more widespread: Nearly 1 in 3 people here in Marin County will leave, part of the roughly 700,000 who his models suggest may abandon the broader Bay Area as a result of sea-level rise alone.\n\nFrom Maine to North Carolina to Texas, rising sea levels are not just chewing up shorelines but also raising rivers and swamping the subterranean infrastructure of coastal communities, making a stable life there all but impossible. Coastal high points will be cut off from roadways, amenities and escape routes, and even far inland, saltwater will seep into underground drinking-water supplies. Eight of the nation’s 20 largest metropolitan areas — Miami, New York and Boston among them — will be profoundly altered, indirectly affecting some 50 million people. Imagine large concrete walls separating Fort Lauderdale, Florida, condominiums from a beachless waterfront, or dozens of new bridges connecting the islands of Philadelphia. Not every city can spend $100 billion on a sea wall, as New York most likely will. Barrier islands? Rural areas along the coast without a strong tax base? They are likely, in the long term, unsalvageable.\n\nIn all, Hauer projects that 13 million Americans will be forced to move away from submerged coastlines. Add to that the people contending with wildfires and other risks, and the number of Americans who might move — though difficult to predict precisely — could easily be tens of millions larger. Even 13 million climate migrants, though, would rank as the largest migration in North American history. The Great Migration — of 6 million Black Americans out of the South from 1916 to 1970 — transformed almost everything we know about America, from the fate of its labor movement to the shape of its cities to the sound of its music. What would it look like when twice that many people moved? What might change?\n\nAmericans have been conditioned not to respond to geographical climate threats as people in the rest of the world do. It is natural that rural Guatemalans or subsistence farmers in Kenya, facing drought or scorching heat, would seek out someplace more stable and resilient. Even a subtle environmental change — a dry well, say — can mean life or death, and without money to address the problem, migration is often simply a question of survival.\n\nBy comparison, Americans are richer, often much richer, and more insulated from the shocks of climate change. They are distanced from the food and water sources they depend on, and they are part of a culture that sees every problem as capable of being solved by money. So even as the average flow of the Colorado River — the water supply for 40 million Western Americans and the backbone of the nation’s vegetable and cattle farming — has declined for most of the last 33 years, the population of Nevada has doubled. At the same time, more than 1.5 million people have moved to the Phoenix metro area, despite its dependence on that same river (and the fact that temperatures there now regularly hit 115 degrees). Since Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida in 1992 — and even as that state has become a global example of the threat of sea-level rise — more than 5 million people have moved to Florida’s shorelines, driving a historic boom in building and real estate.\n\nSimilar patterns are evident across the country. Census data shows us how Americans move: toward heat, toward coastlines, toward drought, regardless of evidence of increasing storms and flooding and other disasters.\n\nHomes being rebuilt near Coffey Park, the California community that was ravaged during the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. Smoke filled the air as a construction crew worked and wildfires raged nearby.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nThe sense that money and technology can overcome nature has emboldened Americans. Where money and technology fail, though, it inevitably falls to government policies — and government subsidies — to pick up the slack. Thanks to federally subsidized canals, for example, water in part of the Desert Southwest costs less than it does in Philadelphia. The federal National Flood Insurance Program has paid to rebuild houses that have flooded six times over in the same spot. And federal agriculture aid withholds subsidies from farmers who switch to drought-resistant crops, while paying growers to replant the same ones that failed. Farmers, seed manufacturers, real estate developers and a few homeowners benefit, at least momentarily, but the gap between what the climate can destroy and what money can replace is growing.\n\nPerhaps no market force has proved more influential — and more misguided — than the nation’s property-insurance system. From state to state, readily available and affordable policies have made it attractive to buy or replace homes even where they are at high risk of disasters, systematically obscuring the reality of the climate threat and fooling many Americans into thinking that their decisions are safer than they actually are. Part of the problem is that most policies look only 12 months into the future, ignoring long-term trends even as insurance availability influences development and drives people’s long-term decision-making.\n\nEven where insurers have tried to withdraw policies or raise rates to reduce climate-related liabilities, state regulators have forced them to provide affordable coverage anyway, simply subsidizing the cost of underwriting such a risky policy or, in some cases, offering it themselves. The regulations — called Fair Access to Insurance Requirements — are justified by developers and local politicians alike as economic lifeboats “of last resort” in regions where climate change threatens to interrupt economic growth. While they do protect some entrenched and vulnerable communities, the laws also satisfy the demand of wealthier homeowners who still want to be able to buy insurance.\n\nAt least 30 states, including Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas, have developed so-called FAIR plans, and today they serve as a market backstop in the places facing the highest risks of climate-driven disasters, including coastal flooding, hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nIn an era of climate change, though, such policies amount to a sort of shell game, meant to keep growth going even when other obvious signs and scientific research suggest that it should stop.\n\nThat’s what happened in Florida. Hurricane Andrew reduced parts of cities to landfill and cost insurers nearly $16 billion in payouts. Many insurance companies, recognizing the likelihood that it would happen again, declined to renew policies and left the state. So the Florida Legislature created a state-run company to insure properties itself, preventing both an exodus and an economic collapse by essentially pretending that the climate vulnerabilities didn’t exist.\n\nAs a result, Florida’s taxpayers by 2012 had assumed liabilities worth some $511 billion — more than seven times the state’s total budget — as the value of coastal property topped $2.8 trillion. Another direct hurricane risked bankrupting the state. Florida, concerned that it had taken on too much risk, has since scaled back its self-insurance plan. But the development that resulted is still in place.\n\nOn a sweltering afternoon last October, with the skies above me full of wildfire smoke, I called Jesse Keenan, an urban-planning and climate-change specialist then at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, who advises the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission on market hazards from climate change. Keenan, who is now an associate professor of real estate at Tulane University’s School of Architecture, had been in the news last year for projecting where people might move to — suggesting that Duluth, Minnesota, for instance, should brace for a coming real estate boom as climate migrants move north. But like other scientists I’d spoken with, Keenan had been reluctant to draw conclusions about where these migrants would be driven from.\n\nLast fall, though, as the previous round of fires ravaged California, his phone began to ring, with private-equity investors and bankers all looking for his read on the state’s future. Their interest suggested a growing investor-grade nervousness about swiftly mounting environmental risk in the hottest real estate markets in the country. It’s an early sign, he told me, that the momentum is about to switch directions. “And once this flips,” he added, “it’s likely to flip very quickly.”\n\nCassidy Plaisance surveying what was left of her friend’s home in Lake Charles, Louisiana, after Hurricane Laura.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nIn fact, the correction — a newfound respect for the destructive power of nature, coupled with a sudden disavowal of Americans’ appetite for reckless development — had begun two years earlier, when a frightening surge in disasters offered a jolting preview of how the climate crisis was changing the rules.\n\nOn Oct. 9, 2017, a wildfire blazed through the suburban blue-collar neighborhood of Coffey Park in Santa Rosa, California, virtually in my own backyard. I awoke to learn that more than 1,800 buildings were reduced to ashes, less than 35 miles from where I slept. Inchlong cinders had piled on my windowsills like falling snow.\n\nThe Tubbs Fire, as it was called, shouldn’t have been possible. Coffey Park is surrounded not by vegetation but by concrete and malls and freeways. So insurers had rated it as “basically zero risk,” according to Kevin Van Leer, then a risk modeler from the global insurance liability firm Risk Management Solutions. (He now does similar work for Cape Analytics.) But Van Leer, who had spent seven years picking through the debris left by disasters to understand how insurers could anticipate — and price — the risk of their happening again, had begun to see other “impossible” fires. After a 2016 fire tornado ripped through northern Canada and a firestorm consumed Gatlinburg, Tennessee, he said, “alarm bells started going off” for the insurance industry.\n\nWhat Van Leer saw when he walked through Coffey Park a week after the Tubbs Fire changed the way he would model and project fire risk forever. Typically, fire would spread along the ground, burning maybe 50% of structures. In Santa Rosa, more than 90% had been leveled. “The destruction was complete,” he told me. Van Leer determined that the fire had jumped through the forest canopy, spawning 70-mile-per-hour winds that kicked a storm of embers into the modest homes of Coffey Park, which burned at an acre a second as homes ignited spontaneously from the radiant heat. It was the kind of thing that might never have been possible if California’s autumn winds weren’t getting fiercer and drier every year, colliding with intensifying, climate-driven heat and ever-expanding development. “It’s hard to forecast something you’ve never seen before,” he said.\n\nFor me, the awakening to imminent climate risk came with California’s rolling power blackouts last fall — an effort to preemptively avoid the risk of a live wire sparking a fire — which showed me that all my notional perspective about climate risk and my own life choices were on a collision course. After the first one, all the food in our refrigerator was lost. When power was interrupted six more times in three weeks, we stopped trying to keep it stocked. All around us, small fires burned. Thick smoke produced fits of coughing. Then, as now, I packed an ax and a go-bag in my car, ready to evacuate. As former Gov. Jerry Brown said, it was beginning to feel like the “new abnormal.”\n\nIt was no surprise, then, that California’s property insurers — having watched 26 years’ worth of profits dissolve over 24 months — began dropping policies, or that California’s insurance commissioner, trying to slow the slide, placed a moratorium on insurance cancellations for parts of the state in 2020. In February, the Legislature introduced a bill compelling California to, in the words of one consumer advocacy group, “follow the lead of Florida” by mandating that insurance remain available, in this case with a requirement that homeowners first harden their properties against fire. At the same time, participation in California’s FAIR plan for catastrophic fires has grown by at least 180% since 2015, and in Santa Rosa, houses are being rebuilt in the very same wildfire-vulnerable zones that proved so deadly in 2017. Given that a new study projects a 20% increase in extreme-fire-weather days by 2035, such practices suggest a special form of climate negligence.\n\nIt’s only a matter of time before homeowners begin to recognize the unsustainability of this approach. Market shock, when driven by the sort of cultural awakening to risk that Keenan observes, can strike a neighborhood like an infectious disease, with fear spreading doubt — and devaluation — from door to door. It happened that way in the foreclosure crisis.\n\nKeenan calls the practice of drawing arbitrary lending boundaries around areas of perceived environmental risk “bluelining,” and indeed many of the neighborhoods that banks are bluelining are the same as the ones that were hit by the racist redlining practice in days past. This summer, climate-data analysts at the First Street Foundation released maps showing that 70% more buildings in the United States were vulnerable to flood risk than previously thought; most of the underestimated risk was in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nSuch neighborhoods see little in the way of flood-prevention investment. My Bay Area neighborhood, on the other hand, has benefited from consistent investment in efforts to defend it against the ravages of climate change. That questions of livability had reached me, here, were testament to Keenan’s belief that the bluelining phenomenon will eventually affect large majorities of equity-holding middle-class Americans too, with broad implications for the overall economy, starting in the nation’s largest state.\n\nUnder the radar, a new class of dangerous debt — climate-distressed mortgage loans — might already be threatening the financial system. Lending data analyzed by Keenan and his co-author, Jacob Bradt, for a study published in the journal Climatic Change in June shows that small banks are liberally making loans on environmentally threatened homes, but then quickly passing them along to federal mortgage backers. At the same time, they have all but stopped lending money for the higher-end properties worth too much for the government to accept, suggesting that the banks are knowingly passing climate liabilities along to taxpayers as stranded assets.\n\nOnce home values begin a one-way plummet, it’s easy for economists to see how entire communities spin out of control. The tax base declines and the school system and civic services falter, creating a negative feedback loop that pushes more people to leave. Rising insurance costs and the perception of risk force credit-rating agencies to downgrade towns, making it more difficult for them to issue bonds and plug the springing financial leaks. Local banks, meanwhile, keep securitizing their mortgage debt, sloughing off their own liabilities.\n\nKeenan, though, had a bigger point: All the structural disincentives that had built Americans’ irrational response to the climate risk were now reaching their logical endpoint. A pandemic-induced economic collapse will only heighten the vulnerabilities and speed the transition, reducing to nothing whatever thin margin of financial protection has kept people in place. Until now, the market mechanisms had essentially socialized the consequences of high-risk development. But as the costs rise — and the insurers quit, and the bankers divest, and the farm subsidies prove too wasteful, and so on — the full weight of responsibility will fall on individual people.\n\nAnd that’s when the real migration might begin.\n\nAs I spoke with Keenan last year, I looked out my own kitchen window onto hillsides of parkland, singed brown by months of dry summer heat. This was precisely the land that my utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, had three times identified as such an imperiled tinderbox that it had to shut off power to avoid fire. It was precisely the kind of wildland-urban interface that all the studies I read blamed for heightening Californians’ exposure to climate risks. I mentioned this on the phone and then asked Keenan, “Should I be selling my house and getting — ”\n\nHe cut me off: “Yes.”\n\nSenior citizens at a cooling center in Phoenix last month during Arizona’s record-setting heat wave.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nAmericans have dealt with climate disaster before. The Dust Bowl started after the federal government expanded the Homestead Act to offer more land to settlers willing to work the marginal soil of the Great Plains. Millions took up the invitation, replacing hardy prairie grass with thirsty crops like corn, wheat and cotton. Then, entirely predictably, came the drought. From 1929 to 1934, crop yields across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri plunged by 60%, leaving farmers destitute and exposing the now-barren topsoil to dry winds and soaring temperatures. The resulting dust storms, some of them taller than skyscrapers, buried homes whole and blew as far east as Washington. The disaster propelled an exodus of some 2.5 million people, mostly to the West, where newcomers — “Okies” not just from Oklahoma but also Texas, Arkansas and Missouri — unsettled communities and competed for jobs. Colorado tried to seal its border from the climate refugees; in California, they were funneled into squalid shanty towns. Only after the migrants settled and had years to claw back a decent life did some towns bounce back stronger.\n\nThe places migrants left behind never fully recovered. Eighty years later, Dust Bowl towns still have slower economic growth and lower per capita income than the rest of the country. Dust Bowl survivors and their children are less likely to go to college and more likely to live in poverty. Climatic change made them poor, and it has kept them poor ever since.\n\nA Dust Bowl event will most likely happen again. The Great Plains states today provide nearly half of the nation’s wheat, sorghum and cattle and much of its corn; the farmers and ranchers there export that food to Africa, South America and Asia. Crop yields, though, will drop sharply with every degree of warming. By 2050, researchers at the University of Chicago and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies found, Dust Bowl-era yields will be the norm, even as demand for scarce water jumps by as much as 20%. Another extreme drought would drive near-total crop losses worse than the Dust Bowl, kneecapping the broader economy. At that point, the authors write, “abandonment is one option.”\n\nProjections are inherently imprecise, but the gradual changes to America’s cropland — plus the steady baking and burning and flooding — suggest that we are already witnessing a slower-forming but much larger replay of the Dust Bowl that will destroy more than just crops. In 2017, Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley, led an analysis of the economic impact of climate-driven changes like rising mortality and rising energy costs, finding that the poorest counties in the United States — mostly across the South and the Southwest — will in some extreme cases face damages equal to more than a third of their gross domestic products. The 2018 National Climate Assessment also warns that the U.S. economy over all could contract by 10%.\n\nThat kind of loss typically drives people toward cities, and researchers expect that trend to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. In 1950, less than 65% of Americans lived in cities. By 2050, only 10% will live outside them, in part because of climatic change. By 2100, Hauer estimates, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston and Austin could each receive more than a quarter million new residents as a result of sea-level displacement alone, meaning it may be those cities — not the places that empty out — that wind up bearing the brunt of America’s reshuffling. The World Bank warns that fast-moving climate urbanization leads to rising unemployment, competition for services and deepening poverty.\n\nA woman lost consciousness in a parking lot in Lake Charles after Hurricane Laura left her without electricity or air conditioning for several days.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nSo what will happen to Atlanta — a metro area of 5.8 million people that may lose its water supply to drought and that our data also shows will face an increase in heat-driven wildfires? Hauer estimates that hundreds of thousands of climate refugees will move into the city by 2100, swelling its population and stressing its infrastructure. Atlanta — where poor transportation and water systems contributed to the state’s C+ infrastructure grade last year — already suffers greater income inequality than any other large American city, making it a virtual tinderbox for social conflict. One in 10 households earns less than $10,000 a year, and rings of extreme poverty are growing on its outskirts even as the city center grows wealthier.\n\nAtlanta has started bolstering its defenses against climate change, but in some cases this has only exacerbated divisions. When the city converted an old Westside rock quarry into a reservoir, part of a larger greenbelt to expand parkland, clean the air and protect against drought, the project also fueled rapid upscale growth, driving the poorest Black communities further into impoverished suburbs. That Atlanta hasn’t “fully grappled with” such challenges now, said Na’Taki Osborne Jelks, chair of the West Atlanta Watershed Alliance, means that with more people and higher temperatures, “the city might be pushed to what’s manageable.”\n\nSo might Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, Boston and other cities with long-neglected systems suddenly pressed to expand under increasingly adverse conditions.\n\nErika González and her son, Kevin, evacuating their home in Sonoma County, California, as the LNU Lightning Complex Fire approached in August.\n(Meridith Kohut for The New York Times)\nOnce you accept that climate change is fast making large parts of the United States nearly uninhabitable, the future looks like this: With time, the bottom half of the country grows inhospitable, dangerous and hot. Something like a tenth of the people who live in the South and the Southwest — from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Southern California — decide to move north in search of a better economy and a more temperate environment. Those who stay behind are disproportionately poor and elderly.\n\nIn these places, heat alone will cause as many as 80 additional deaths per 100,000 people — the nation’s opioid crisis, by comparison, produces 15 additional deaths per 100,000. The most affected people, meanwhile, will pay 20% more for energy, and their crops will yield half as much food or in some cases virtually none at all. That collective burden will drag down regional incomes by roughly 10%, amounting to one of the largest transfers of wealth in American history, as people who live farther north will benefit from that change and see their fortunes rise.\n\nThe millions of people moving north will mostly head to the cities of the Northeast and Northwest, which will see their populations grow by roughly 10%, according to one model. Once-chilly places like Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont will become more temperate, verdant and inviting. Vast regions will prosper; just as Hsiang’s research forecast that Southern counties could see a tenth of their economy dry up, he projects that others as far as North Dakota and Minnesota will enjoy a corresponding expansion. Cities like Detroit; Rochester, New York; Buffalo and Milwaukee will see a renaissance, with their excess capacity in infrastructure, water supplies and highways once again put to good use. One day, it’s possible that a high-speed rail line could race across the Dakotas, through Idaho’s up-and-coming wine country and the country’s new breadbasket along the Canadian border, to the megalopolis of Seattle, which by then has nearly merged with Vancouver to its north.\n\nSitting in my own backyard one afternoon this summer, my wife and I talked through the implications of this looming American future. The facts were clear and increasingly foreboding. Yet there were so many intangibles — a love of nature, the busy pace of life, the high cost of moving — that conspired to keep us from leaving. Nobody wants to migrate away from home, even when an inexorable danger is inching ever closer. They do it when there is no longer any other choice.\n\n\n\nAl Shaw contributed reporting.\n\n\n\nClarification, Sept. 16, 2020: This article was updated to clarify that the mapping of danger zones was done by ProPublica staff.\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Climate Change Will Force a New American Migration","url":"https://www.propublica.org/article/climate-change-will-force-a-new-american-migration","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1600399168,"author":null,"dateadded":"2020-09-17 21:27:44","comment":"Cape schools don’t want want to take ferry to islands this year  ","excerpt":"No interscholastic Nantucket sports this fall - News  The Inquirer and Mirror","extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"There was also an issue with other Cape & Islands League schools feeling uncomfortable traveling by ferry to schools on Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard.

That means his Martha&#8217;s Vineyard boys cross country team wouldn&#8217;t get to defend its 2019 Division 2 All-State championship, the first in program history.\n&#8220;There was a feeling that we should prove to people that even after losing a couple seniors last year, we were still going to be competitive in the postseason,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Repeating would&#8217;ve been awesome.&#8221;\nRichards, now a senior, faces the reality of not only not getting another shot at a title, but not even getting to race against an opposing team. The Martha&#8217;s Vineyard School Committee voted Monday to offer only intramural athletics this fall, withdrawing the Vineyarders from all interscholastic competition.\nNantucket announced a similar decision Thursday afternoon.\n&#8220;Whatever the School Committee chose was the best choice for the kids to keep us safe, but it is unfortunate that we&#8217;re not able to run,&#8221; girls cross country runner Eloise Christy said.\nChristy&#8217;s sister Adrienne added, &#8220;I was looking forward to it a bunch. I was training throughout the summer, and it&#8217;s a great thing to run with other people.&#8221;\nThe committee&#8217;s decision followed a recommendation from its health and safety committee that student-athletes be restricted to on-island play. The latest map from the Department of Public Health shows Martha&#8217;s Vineyard as having fewer than five total reported cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which wiped out the spring high school season and delayed the fall preseason until today.\nA full interscholastic season would mean athletes and coaches would frequently board ferries and travel to communities with potentially higher infection rates, then return home.\n&#8220;I would&#8217;ve liked to have played, and I know our kids would like to have played, because the MIAA and the league are doing that, and we wanted to give our kids an opportunity,&#8221; Vineyard athletic director Mark McCarthy said. &#8220;The health and safety committee, and then eventually the School Committee, felt that this was the safest thing to do, and I&#8217;m not going to argue with that.&#8221;\nMcCarthy said the school hasn&#8217;t decided yet on whether to move its fall offerings to &#8220;Fall II,&#8221; the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association&#8217;s floating season that will begin Feb. 22. MIAA rules allow for schools to petition to move their fall offerings to Fall II, but McCarthy said he&#8217;s unsure who his teams would play.\nThe Cape &amp; Islands League, of which MV is a member, is still planning to compete in all sports except volleyball and football this fall. The MIAA also has recommended schools limit their schedules to in-league games.\n&#8220;There probably isn&#8217;t going to be anybody to play in Fall II,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;Everybody else is playing now.&#8221;\nThe school&#8217;s decision is designed to eliminate competition off the island, but it also could result in MV student-athletes going off the island anyway for club competitions. Andrew Marchand, a league all-star in boys golf last fall, said he competed in a golf tournament in Seekonk over the summer and likely will do so again this fall.\n&#8220;A majority of the other players on our team have signed up for a bunch of Challenge Cup tournaments,&#8221; said Peter Gillis, another boys golf league all-star last fall. &#8220;As a golfer, we have less concern for the coronavirus than football or soccer, where people are more bunched up. Unfortunately, they shut it down on Monday, which was really disappointing.&#8221;\nRuby Reimann, a girls soccer goalkeeper and all-star for the Vineyard last fall, also will play elsewhere this fall. Thursday was her first practice with the Seacoast United club team, but she said she&#8217;ll still participate in whatever intramural activities there are.\n&#8220;We are allowed some kind of play, and I think that&#8217;s something that we have to think positively about,&#8221; Reimann said. &#8220;Sports provide a really good structure for students, whether it&#8217;s friendships, lessons, how to compete, a lot of valuable lessons that you can&#8217;t be taught through a computer. I think that&#8217;s important for kids right now, especially now that we&#8217;re spending most of our day at home.&#8221;\nNantucket&#8217;s decision came following the latest DPH update, which classified Nantucket as a &#8220;red&#8221; zone, with more than eight reported cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 population over the past two weeks.

It's been about a month now of almost daily smoke-filled air.\n\r\nFires:\n\r\nThere are plenty of fires surrounding us on 3 sides...\n\r\n\n\r\n...and smoke is easily blowing into the basin no matter which way the wind blows. Here is a look at the current smoke map on OpenSummit.com.&#160;\n\r\n\n\r\nEven an east wind will have to blow the smoke out that's sitting to the east in NV.\n\r\nForecast:\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have the usual prevailing west/southwest wind in the forecast for the rest of the week. The temperatures have cooled into the 70s for highs at lake level so it's not as hot as the last several weeks, but the winds will be increasing later this week as a trough approaches the West Coast.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat will tighten the pressure gradient with increasing winds by Thursday into Friday. That will only increase the fire danger in the dry climate over CA. Here is a look at the Mt. Rose summit forecast from OpenSummit.com showing the winds, and the colder temperatures this week above 10k if you happen to be hiking. This is for the actual Mt. Rose the mountain, not the ski area, although it's right near it.\n\r\n\n\r\nSome model runs over the last several days were showing the possibility that the system for the end of the week would dip far enough south to bring a few showers to the Sierra and Tahoe area. But the latest model runs keep the precipitation to our north. As of right now, it looks like just a&#160; dry wind event, unfortunately. The Pacific NW will pick up some light precipitation, hopefully at least enough to put down some of the fires and clean up the air a bit.\n\r\nIt will cool us down into the 60s for highs for Friday-Saturday before high pressure builds back in over the weekend and warms us back into the 70s going into next week.&#160;\n\r\nLong-Range Forecast:\n\r\nThe long-range models are pretty much all in agreement that a large trough could push into the northeast Pacific by the last week of September, around the 24th/25th.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat is pretty good agreement that far out especially during the change in the seasons. This is something to keep an eye on over the next 2 weeks. This is a large and cold trough that would push storms into the Pacific NW. We would be on the southern edge, but a small shift in the storm track to the south and we could get some much need precipitation?&#160;\n\r\nThe Canadian ensembles are the farthest south with precipitation this far out. Fingers crossed...\n\r\n\n\r\nOctober:\n\r\nThe long-range climate models have been hinting at a wetter October as we have discussed in earlier posts. The CFSv2 and other models like the European seasonal and weekly models show a wetter month in October, especially later in the month.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat map already looks similar to a La Nina pattern, but also an early-season pattern with the jet stream aimed to our north. Things can change fast around here later in October. We will be watching with anticipation for heavy rain and snow that could put a quick end to the fire season, at least for northern CA.\n\r\nThe Winter Season:\n\r\nIt's still too early to forecast the winter season, per my annual post talking about how you can't forecast a winter season this far out... But I am dreaming of a white winter after ours was stolen from us last season by the virus that I won't mention by name to not give it the infamy it craves. My new board showed up about one week before the closures...\n\r\n\n\r\nSo here my board and I sit, searching the historical charts and trying to line them up for a dreamy winter full of deep days... The kind that will be much-needed medicine to the soul.\n\r\nI've done several posts already on the upcoming season. I usually don't post any kind of a winter forecast until later in October. But some early season ramblings to clear my head won't hurt, right? Anything to keep me from scrolling through my Twitter feed...\n\r\nThe unbreakable but realistic optimism you can count on from me. If you have been following along the last 14 seasons, wait a minute, this will be my 15th season forecasting??? Man, where has the time gone?&#160;\n\r\n\n\r\nThe facial hair definitely grows faster at 40.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for following the rants through the years! We've been through a lot together. A few drought years to start, a few good years including my favorite season 10/11! Then more drought years... A surprisingly amazing season in 16/17, a come from behind Miracle in 18/19, and tragedy in 19/20.&#160;\n\r\nSo what will 20/21 bring? No one really knows for certain. I'm still hesitant to share my musings this early. So please keep this between you and me, shhh.\n\r\nNOAA has upped the chances for a La Nina pattern now to 75%. We have fairly cold water along the equator already, in the moderate La Nina range.&#160;\n\r\n\n\r\nThe current PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) reading is slightly negative thanks to some colder water. But the vast majority of the northern Pacific is still warmer than average. I'm more interested in the warm water in the Indian Ocean into the Western Pacific and the blob of warmer water north of Hawaii. How does this setup compare to my favorite season?\n\r\n\n\r\nSomewhat similar in those 3 regions, but it was colder from the West Coast back to Hawaii in September 2010. That was a strong La Nina season. I'd like to see that warm blob north/northwest of Hawaii and some colder water off the coast. The 16/17 season was a weak La Nina with the water warmer off the West Coast.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe current SST map looks like it's in between the two. Here is a look at a typical La Nina pattern.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is a look at the height pattern forecast by the CFSv2 and the JMA for Dec - Feb?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe CFSv2 has higher heights a little closer to the West Coast and the JMA in a more favorable position to the north/northwest of Hawaii. I'd keep an eye on the blob of warmer water as we go through the fall to see where it sets up, and if we see cooler water develop off the west coast.&#160;\n\r\nI like the warmer water in the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific as we hope for an active MJO ( Madden Julian Oscillation) through that area this season. That combined with the positions of the mean ridge could mean the difference between a 10/11 or 16/17 season? Or a non-active MJO and the ridge closer to West Coast and another dry season?...\n\r\nAdding in the PDO, QBO, and other factors, and looking back through the last 50 years, I look for years with similar conditions and assign scores. The highest score I'm getting right now is 1970/71 (119% of average snowfall). The 5 most similar seasons are giving me an average of 124% of average snowfall with only one season below average.&#160;\n\r\nThis is assuming we stay with a moderate La Nina. Downgrading to weak and looking at other patterns being similar to this season's forecast, we would add 5 seasons with 3 of 5 below average but one of those seasons being the 16/17 season with 141% of average snowfall, and the average of those 5 seasons at 103% of average. The average of the 10 most similar seasons I'm coming up with right now has an average of 113% of average.\n\r\nSo suffice to say that I'm optimistic for this season based on historical data vs the forecast for the pattern this season. The most optimistic since the 2010/11 season when I had a forecast for 125% of average snowfall and we ended up with 158% of average. I took a beating in gossip circles around town that fall, but that was the only season I went out on a limb like that in the last 10 years.&#160;\n\r\nIt's still too early to make a forecast. A lot can change going into the winter. Just unloading my musings for the week as I look forward to winter. But this is 2020 where nothing seems to go right... Maybe it will be a continuation of bad for those that hate snow and those who moved to Tahoe this summer to escape the city and have no idea what they are in for during a big season, and a change in luck for the rest of us! Only one type of person can have big snow be bad, not both if the ski resorts are open.\n\r\nSpeaking of which. A lot coming out about how the ski resorts will operate this season. Some with reservations, others without but limiting pass sales. It will be interesting to see how it works.&#160;\n\r\nIt will take a lot to keep me off the hill this season if the mountains are open and the snow is falling. But you will find me socially distanced in the side country or in the trees, as usual. Not a fan of crowds in any season. Prayers for those who have been affected, and praying we see a positive turn of events going forward, in many aspects. High hopes for this season, think positive, be kind to all.\n\r\nStay tuned...BA\n\r\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                    \n                        Upgrade to All-Access and receive exclusive benefits.\n\n                         Hourly Forecasts for 3 days\n                             Daily Forecasts for 10 days\n                             Favorite &amp; Timelapse Cams\n                             Custom Forecast Alerts\n                             No Banner Advertisements\n                             OpenSummit All-Access\n                        See the whole picture for only $19/year and never miss another powder day.\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n\n        \n    ","title":"Fire Season Drags On as We Wait for Relief...","url":"https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/tahoe/post/18913","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1600120501,"author":"By Ben Rothenberg","dateadded":"2020-09-14 21:25:28","comment":null,"excerpt":"In his first news conference since being disqualified from the Open, Djokovic said he hoped to be a “wiser” player.","extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"Djokovic admitted that his disqualification, although somewhat unlucky, was “not completely out of the blue” given his propensity for expressing anger on the court, which has sometimes included being reckless with equipment.","highlight2":"“I’m working mentally and emotionally as hard as I am physically, trying to be the best version of myself on the court, off the court,” Djokovic said Monday from Rome, where he will compete in the Italian Open this week. “I understand that I have outbursts and it’s the personality and kind of player that I have always been.”He added: “Obviously I went through ups and downs in my career, managing to control my emotions more or less.

But you&#8217;re alone out there, it&#8217;s a lot of intensity, a lot of pressure, and you have to deal with all of that.&#8221;\nDjokovic spoke with reporters at length Monday for the first time since he was defaulted in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. While behind in the first set against Pablo Carre&#241;o Busta, Djokovic hit a ball about 40 feet, from the court toward a back wall, where it hit a line judge in the throat. She collapsed, and Djokovic tried to comfort her. After a lengthy discussion with tournament officials, he was disqualified, upending the men&#8217;s singles draw.\n&#8220;The rules are clear when it comes to that,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;I accepted it, and I had to move on.&#8221;\nUntil then, Djokovic had not lost a match all season and was heavily favored to win the U.S. Open, which would have been his 18th Grand Slam tournament title. Dominic Thiem, seeded second, beat Alexander Zverev for the title on Sunday night in a thriller that ended with a tiebreaker in the fifth set.\nDjokovic admitted that his disqualification, although somewhat unlucky, was &#8220;not completely out of the blue&#8221; given his propensity for expressing anger on the court, which has sometimes included being reckless with equipment.\nAt the 2016 French Open, he swiped his racket in anger and it slipped out of his hand, just missing a line judge. He could have been defaulted, but he went on to win the tournament &#8212; his only French Open victory.\nLater that season, he quibbled with a reporter at the ATP Finals after hitting a ball into the stands without hitting anyone. The reporter said it could have been dangerous for spectators.\n&#8220;It could have been, yes,&#8221; Djokovic said at the time, bristling at the reporter&#8217;s suggestion that the behavior might be part of a pattern. &#8220;It could have snowed in O2 Arena, as well, but it didn&#8217;t.&#8221;\nHis defiance then appeared to be much different from his sentiment on Monday, when he said he was &#8220;really sorry to cause the shock and drama&#8221; for the line judge who was hit.\n&#8220;She didn&#8217;t deserve that in any way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She obviously is volunteering as well and doing her work. She loves tennis, and she&#8217;s been there, as I understood, for quite a few years.&#8221;\nHe stopped short of guaranteeing a something similar would not happen in future tournaments, but said he would certainly remember it and learn from it.\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have any major issues coming back to the tour and being able to perform well and hit the tennis ball &#8212; of course, during the point,&#8221; he said.\nAt the coming French Open, Djokovic will aim to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win each Grand Slam tournament twice. He said he was glad to have new goals to focus on right away, though he still considers the 12-time French Open champion, Rafael Nadal, as the clear favorite.\n&#8220;Rafa obviously decided to stay on clay and practice, and surely that gives him more advantage,&#8221; Djokovic said of Nadal, the 2019 U.S. Open champion who skipped an attempt at a repeat because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n&#8220;Even if he didn&#8217;t practice for that long on clay, he would still be the No. 1 favorite in Roland Garros or any other clay tournament because he&#8217;s Rafa,&#8221; Djokovic added. &#8220;Playing on clay, he&#8217;s the ultimate challenge.&#8221;\nNadal is among many players, including second-ranked Simona Halep, who will be returning to major competition after declining to travel to the United States during the health crisis.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious that to feel 100 percent, you need matches. But here I am,&#8221; Nadal said Monday. &#8220;I arrived with plenty of time to try to have the right practices.&#8221;\nAt the Italian Open, Nadal will play his first match against Carre&#241;o Busta, who after facing Djokovic reached the U.S. Open semifinal.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a good test,&#8221; Nadal said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about going back to competition, without big expectations.&#8221;\nHalep figures to be the top seed in the women&#8217;s singles draw at the French Open because the defending champion, Ashleigh Barty, the WTA No. 1, does not plan to play.\nLike Nadal, Halep said she had &#8220;no regrets&#8221; about choosing to skip the U.S. Open.\n&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m sad I didn&#8217;t play, it&#8217;s normal, but I feel like my decision was great for the health issue and to feel relaxed inside,&#8221; Halep said.\nHalep, the 2018 French Open champion, won a WTA tournament in Prague on clay last month.\n&#8220;I always have been secure and happy on the clay, and now I&#8217;ve had four or five months playing only on clay &#8212; I&#8217;m not used to that,&#8221; Halep said. &#8220;I feel comfortable and ready to play here. I love this tournament. I love French Open, so hopefully I can play my best and win some matches.&#8221;\nWatching the U.S. Open and Djokovic&#8217;s disqualification, Halep said, was a reminder to consider the safety of others on the court.\n&#8220;We have to really be careful because people are around us and we don&#8217;t have to react that bad during the matches because it&#8217;s just a tennis match,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was not nice for anybody.&#8221;\n","title":"Djokovic, After U.S. Open, Says He Is Working on the Mental Side of Tennis","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/sports/tennis/djokovic-us-open-mental-side.html","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1600143623,"author":null,"dateadded":"2020-09-14 21:20:41","comment":null,"excerpt":null,"extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":null,"highlight2":null,"images":"https://sfbay-media-library.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/2020/09/09141012/200909_Firesky0096_bay104-844x563.jpg","image":"https://sfbay-media-library.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/2020/09/09141012/200909_Firesky0096_bay104-844x563.jpg","id":"83ba441c-4aa1-5e78-b75f-3c2a0df6a0c2","keywords":null,"publishdate":"2020 09 14","source":"SFBay","source2":"SFBay","tags":"Bay Area ,noteworthy links","text":"\nAir quality in the Bay Area is expected to remain unhealthy through most of this week due to smoke from wildfires along the West Coast, a spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District said Monday.\n\nThe Bay Area’s air quality will be unhealthy for all residents on Monday and Tuesday, and unhealthy for sensitive groups on Wednesday, air district spokeswoman Kristine Roselius said.\n\nScot Tucker / SFBay.ca) A person walks up a hill at Seal Point Park as the sky, full of particles from California wildfires is blanketed by fog, low lying clouds and little wind in San Mateo, CA., on Wednesday, September 9, 2020.

(Copernicus via ESA)\nEven in a year that has already featured many well-justified superlatives, it is becoming genuinely difficult to articulate just how severe the ongoing wildfire emergency has become in California. The numbers were already shocking back during the August lightning bust and subsequent wildfire siege, but those August numbers now look modest in comparison to today&#8217;s astonishing statistics.\n\nAround 3.5 million acres have burned so far in California in 2020. That&#8217;s around 3.5% of the entire land area of the state, and is approaching double the previous record for the greatest acreage burned during a single year in the modern record (~1.9 million acres in 2018). The August Complex, which began initially as a series of lightning fires back in August but have now merged into a single contiguous fire extending many miles in every direction, is now approaching ~900,000 acres in size and has burned most of the Mendocino National Forest. This is now California largest fire on record by a ridiculous margin&#8211;it&#8217;s essentially double the previous record, previously set just two years ago in 2018. Given the minimal containment on this fire and continued adverse fire weather conditions expected in the coming days, I would expect the August Complex to become California&#8217;s first true modern &#8220;megafire&#8221; in the coming days&#8211;a single contiguous event burning over 1 million acres.\n\n\n\n\nThe human toll has been rising, too. The death toll from the California and Oregon fires continues to rise into the dozens, and the news coming out of the Bear Fire/North Complex is particularly sobering. Multiple small towns and neighborhoods in Butte County were overrun by the fire in the middle of the night as it made an astonishing ~200,000 acre run in less than 24 hours&#8211;creating conditions eerily similar to that of the Camp Fire back in 2018. The only saving grace in this instance is that there were no large towns in the direct path, but the devastation in north and east of Oroville is immense, and as yet largely untold. Heroic rescues, during which hundreds of people have been extricated under extremely dire circumstances, have been commonplace in recent days&#8211;including a mobilization of the California Air National Guard for daring midnight helicopter evacuations. Thousands of structures have burned just in California so far this season, and the toll continues to climb. \n\n\nWidespread &#8220;smokestorm&#8221; conditions persist West Coast-wide\n\n\n\nThen, on top of all of that: the smoke. An extremely large volume of dense, choking smoke has been generated by these numerous extreme large wildfires across California, Oregon, and Washington&#8211;leading to &#8220;smokestorm&#8221; conditions of historic proportions extending all the way from the Mexican to Canadian border (and even farther, at times). Air quality has ranged from &#8220;poor&#8221; to &#8220;extremely hazardous&#8221; across California for many consecutive days&#8211;making it difficult to even open windows, let alone spend time outside.\n\nEven more dramatic, though, was the vertical depth and density of these smoke plumes last week. At one point, multiple fires were generating explosive pyrocumulonimbus (fire thunderstorm) clouds that injected smoke all the way toward the top of the troposphere and even briefly into the stratosphere.

Aside from dramatically altering everyday life, these dense smoke plumes have also radically altered local meteorology&#8211;bringing temperatures 10-20 degrees cooler than the ambient airmass would support as solar radiation was largely unable to penetrate the plumes.\n\n\n\nHow did we get here? Record heat (x2) immediately followed by unusually early offshore wind event\n\n\n\nCalifornia experienced a searing, record-breaking, and long duration heatwave in mid-August (coincident with the dry lightning that provided the initial spark that ignited many of the fires still burning). Then over Labor Day weekend, a shorter but even more intense heatwave arrived&#8211;bringing all-time (any month) record temperatures to portions of California, especially in the south. LA County saw its highest temperature in recorded history (121F), and San Luis Obispo reached 120F&#8211;possibly setting a new record in the Americas for the hottest temperature so close to an oceanic coast. In the end, August 2020 turned out to be the hottest August on record in California.\n\nAnd then, across the Pacific Northwest, the offshore winds arrived. An unusually powerful early season storm over the interior west generated an extreme surface pressure differential, which bring once-in-a-generation easterly winds to Oregon as well as strong winds to the fire areas in NoCal. These extreme winds in Oregon were themselves the cause of some of the numerous, extremely large fires now burning&#8211;numerous trees and power lines were knocked down. If you&#8217;re interested in the genuinely fascinating series of meteorological events leading up to the historic post-Labor Day wind and fire event, I&#8217;d encourage you to click and read the full Twitter thread below.\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern shift will bring smoke relief, but winds may fan flames\nCooler conditions and more wind will accompany the PacNW low in California; increased winds may help dissipate smoke as well as increase fire activity.The upcoming pattern shift is a classic &#8220;good news, bad news&#8221; situation. I&#8217;ll start with the good: increasingly strong and vertically deep southwesterly winds over California and the PacNW will slowly start to scour out the smoke and hazardous air quality that has plagued the region for days on end. These winds won&#8217;t bring instant relief&#8211;there is actually still quite a lot of smoke out over the Pacific to blow inland first&#8211;but I do expect surface air quality to improve gradually but steadily over the next few days. Vertical mixing will also improve&#8211;so even if there is elevated smoke remaining higher in the atmosphere, it might become more reasonable to open windows and perform outdoor activities as smoke gets less concentrated near the surface.\n\n\n\nThe other good news is that the incoming low pressure system will bring a round of modest but widespread showers to the Pacific Northwest, from about the central Oregon coast northward into British Columbia. These PacNW showers will help to temporarily reduce fire intensity in these regions and clear the air. Despite much excitement over the weekend, however, it looks increasingly unlikely that substantial precipitation will fall anywhere in California from this event. Scattered light showers are possible across the far north coast and mountains&#8211;where there are indeed fires currently burning&#8211;but accumulations will likely remain around or under 0.1 inches. Some coastal drizzle from an enhanced marine layer is also possible as far south as the SF Bay Area, but that will likely only penetrate a few miles inland. Elsewhere in California, I don&#8217;t expect any precipitation to fall with this event.\n\nOne other possible fly in the ointment&#8211;it&#8217;s not likely, but there may be a slight chance that the incoming low could entrain enough subtropical moisture to lead to some elevated convective cloudiness later this week. This would be unlikely to generate any precipitation at the surface, but there is a slight chance that it could produce isolated dry lightning strikes over the southern Sierra. I am not overly concerned about this at the moment, since odds are low, but it&#8217;s something to keep an eye on given the magnitude of the ongoing fires in that part of the state.\n\nThe bad news: winds will increase across the northern part of California over the next couple of days, likely increasing fire activity and generating large fire runs in a northward and northeastward direction. In fact, a Red Flag Warning for these winds is currently in effect for most of northeastern CA, including the Bear Fire/North Complex region. These won&#8217;t be extreme winds, but they will probably still be enough to exacerbate fire conditions (despite some increased humidity that will accompany them).\n\nAn incoming trough and low pressure system will bring wetting rains from central Oregon northward, but will bring only a chance of shower to far NorCal.Temperatures will continue to run below predicted levels until the smoke substantially clears, which should happen in the next day or two. Thereafter, I do expect a small warming trend to near or slightly above seasonal levels by the coming weekend&#8211;although no big heat waves are on the horizon. There are hints of a possible brief offshore wind event this coming weekend as well, so that will also have to be monitored from a fire weather perspective.\n\nOnce again, I am sorry that I don&#8217;t have any solidly good news to convey in this blog update&#8211;though I think many may be cheered by the prospect of improving air quality, at least.\n\nAnd finally: I hope everyone is hanging in there in these seriously trying times. On that note, I will simply leave you with my own sentiment regarding the ongoing wildfire crisis (among other things):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"Severe wildfire conditions will continue across California, but pattern shift will improve air quality","url":"https://weatherwest.com/archives/7532","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1600103714,"author":"Jason Kottke","dateadded":"2020-09-14 14:41:11","comment":null,"excerpt":null,"extractedkeywords":null,"highlight":"A group of astronomers have announced that they’ve discovered evidence that there may be life in the atmosphere of Venus.\n","highlight2":"But the finding will also encourage some planetary scientists to ask whether humanity has overlooked a planet that may have once been more Earthlike than any other world in our solar system.","images":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/venus-life.jpg","image":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/venus-life.jpg","id":"c20e9d8a-39a7-5c69-baba-844facbed213","keywords":null,"publishdate":"2020 09 14","source":"kottke.org","source2":"kottke.org","tags":"tech,noteworthy links","text":"\n\nA group of astronomers have announced that they’ve discovered evidence that there may be life in the atmosphere of Venus.\n\nThe astronomers, who reported the finding on Monday in a pair of papers, have not collected specimens of Venusian microbes, nor have they snapped any pictures of them.

I&#8217;ve been waiting for the inevitable backlash and it appears to be here.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this week JP Morgan told senior employees of the bank&#8217;s giant sales and trading operation that they and their teams must return to the office by Sept. 21.\n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings was profiled in no less than 347 pieces this week on his book promo tour but I was more interested in his comments about the work from home trend than his business philosophy. This was his exchange with Joe Flint of the WSJ on the matter:\n\nWSJ: What elements of the Netflix culture are tougher to maintain now that so many employees are working from home?\n\nMr. Hastings: Debating ideas is harder now.\n\nWSJ: Have you seen benefits from people working at home?\n\nMr. Hastings: No. I don&#8217;t see any positives. Not being able to get together in person, particularly internationally, is a pure negative. I&#8217;ve been super impressed at people&#8217;s sacrifices.\n\nWSJ: It&#8217;s been anticipated that many companies will shift to a work-from-home approach for many employees even after the Covid-19 crisis. What do you think?\n\nMr. Hastings: If I had to guess, the five-day workweek will become four days in the office while one day is virtual from home. I&#8217;d bet that&#8217;s where a lot of companies end up.\n\nWSJ: Do you have a date in mind for when your workforce returns to the office?\n\nMr. Hastings: Twelve hours after a vaccine is approved.\n\nTell us how what you really think, Reed.\n\nNetflix is notorious for being a hard place to work. They are far from the only corporation that thinks like this.\n\nThere is inequality everywhere you look during the pandemic and the ability to work remotely illustrates this perfectly (via Bloomberg):\n\nI actually think this is the kind of thing that could work against a lot of high-earners as we begin to normalize (whenever that might be). Working from home will be seen as a perk for many employees and there are sure to be companies that recognize the benefits of allowing their employees more freedom and flexibility.\n\nBut there are sure to be many large corporations with the attitude of&#160;If you&#8217;re making this much money, you better be in the office.&#160;People on the high end of the income scale may have the ability to work from home now but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on all of them keeping that perk going forward. There will still be plenty of old school firms with the midset of Netflix and JP Morgan on this.\n\nThe pandemic has hit people differently not just depending on their income level or ability to work from home but also their stage in life. As a parent, I can confidently say having kids has made this period so much more challenging because school has been so disrupted. Trying to home school while also working from home is like trying to juggle chainsaws while preparing your child a snack.\n\nMany cities and states have gone totally virtual. My daughter is currently doing a hybrid approach where she&#8217;s only been in school two days each week. With the large number of dual income households in this country, we are not set up for virtual schooling.\n\nSo companies have been forced into allowing more people to work from home because of these circumstances. We&#8217;re only 6 months or so into this new world but it appears the non-parents of the world are already annoyed by what this means for their fellow employees with children. This is from a story this week in the New York Times:\n\nWhen the coronavirus closed schools and child care centers and turned American parenthood into a multitasking nightmare, many tech companies rushed to help their employees. They used their comfortable profit margins to extend workers new benefits, including extra time off for parents to help them care for their children.\n\nIt wasn&#8217;t long before employees without children started to ask: What about us?\n\nAt a recent companywide meeting, Facebook employees repeatedly argued that work policies created in response to Covid-19 &#8220;have primarily benefited parents.&#8221; At Twitter, a fight erupted on an internal message board after a worker who didn&#8217;t have children at home accused another employee, who was taking a leave to care for a child, of not pulling his weight.\n\nWhen Salesforce announced that it was offering parents six weeks of paid time off, most employees applauded. But one Salesforce manager, who is not permitted to talk publicly about internal matters and therefore asked not to be identified, said two childless employees, reflecting a sentiment voiced at several companies, complained that the policy seemed to put parents&#8217; needs ahead of theirs.\n\nI&#8217;m biased here because I&#8217;m a parent but I&#8217;m surprised there isn&#8217;t more of a team element going on at these companies. I suppose some of these young tech non-parents simply don&#8217;t understand what their colleagues are going through.\n\nBut this issue shows how the work from home trend could cause dissension among employees if it becomes a permanent shift for certain companies.\n\nAre the employees who go into the office more going to resent their colleagues who prefer to work from home?\n\nWill those employees who do show up get preferential treatment and more opportunities for advancement?\n\nWill office politics now include WFH vs non-WFH factions?\n\nIn March, many companies were forced into a work from home situation whether they wanted to or not.

Young children, the elderly and others who may be frailer because of health conditions could be more affected by the smoke. And while there are many studies on the health impact of air pollution, there’s been less research on how acute exposure can affect a population.\nWhat Was in the Smoke\nHeavy winds during the blazes carried particulate matter across the Bay Area, and the scent of campfire was an indicator that most of the smoke came from burning wood, Balmes said.\nMost worrisome are so-called PM2.5 particles, tiny particulate matter small enough to lodge deep in the lung. These hydrocarbon particles chemically injure the lung tissue, causing inflammation.\nThough the majority of the smoke was from wood and grass burning, the fires also burned through neighborhoods and other areas with buildings, adding particles from cars, furniture and other goods.\nThose toxic particles were likely to be diluted considerably as the smoke traveled through cleaner air on its journey throughout the Bay Area, Balmes said, but just what particles were released from the manmade materials remains unclear. Atmospheric chemists from UC Berkeley, where Balmes is also a professor of environmental science, confirmed that the particles were mostly from burning wood. Still, he said, the smoke plume contained various toxic agents, which would be expected from the combustion of any carbon-based fuel.\nImpacts Beyond the Lungs\nWith a vast majority of the Bay Area affected by the smoke, it was difficult to avoid inhaling some particles. For people who may be concerned about their respiratory system, the good news is that the lungs of most healthy adults can recover fully from smoke damage, even in severe cases, according to Balmes. “It’s similar to recovering from a severe bout of pneumonia,” he said.\nOf course, groups that are more vulnerable to long-term effects of pneumonia are also more likely to be affected by smoke: young children, the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.\nSmoke inhalation can exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though the effects may not be permanent. In some cases, extreme smoke inhalation can cause asthma that is triggered by future exposures to smoke.\nWhile most people in vulnerable groups will recover once the fires are out, Balmes suggests that people continuing to experience wheezing, cough, or shortness of breath see a health care provider.\nDuring the crisis, public health officials urged people to stay indoors and avoid bringing in any air from the outside. N95 respirators, which filter out PM2.5, were widely recommended – and used in hospitals – for those whose health was more vulnerable.\nSurprisingly, the greatest risk factor with inhaling the smoky air isn’t respiratory, but cardiovascular.\n“The American Heart Association recognizes outdoor particles as an effector for short- and long-term health effects,” Balmes said.\nThe risk is three-fold: Inflammation in the lungs can become systemic, affecting the whole body’s vascular function; the risk for blood clots increases, which can lead to heart attack or stroke; and the autonomic nervous system is stimulated, which can cause heart arrhythmia. In addition, Balmes said, “There’s good evidence that these effects can accelerate atherosclerosis, the plaques that build up inside blood vessels.”\nThe cardiovascular impacts, however, appear to be temporary, and these effects usually subside after the smoke does, Balmes said. The largest risk from the fire is likely to have passed since acute exposure to smoke in the moment could lead to arrhythmia or a heart attack, which can have long-lasting consequences.\nPublic health officials continue to urge caution during the fire cleanup. Ash from burned homes and other items will likely contain metals, chemicals, and potentially asbestos, which may be considered toxic if breathed in or touched with wet skin. They recommend wearing N95 respirators, gloves, long sleeves and long pants; using water for cleanup rather than dry-sweeping to keep ash out of the air; and keeping children and those vulnerable to health issues away from the ash.\nThe Need for More Research\nThe hardest part for doctors and researchers is understanding how much acute exposure to wildland fire smoke could lead to longer-term health problems.\nStudies on long-term exposure to air pollutants have shown an impact on the immune system. In a study Balmes conducted on children, he found that some kids chronically exposed to certain air pollutants that are also found in smoke can develop new allergies or chronic asthma. However, those cases would have involved chronic exposure over months rather than days.\nBalmes said he doesn’t think anyone has been able to study over time the effects of acute smoke exposure.\n“I think there’s great interest in doing that,” he said. “But fires are unpredictable in terms of their timing. Unless someone has a cohort assembled for some other reason, it’s hard to pull together enough folks to study properly on a longitudinal basis.”\nWhile tragic, the fires in the North Bay present an opportunity for researchers to learn more about the long-term effects of exposure to smoke. “Particularly for cardiovascular outcomes,” Balmes said. “There’s lots of room for more research.”\n\n","title":"For Many, No Long-Term Health Impacts from Wildfire Smoke, But More Studies Needed","url":"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/10/408766/many-no-long-term-health-impacts-wildfire-smoke-more-studies-needed","popularity":null}},{"node":{"articleid":1596702312,"author":"Seth Godin","dateadded":"2020-09-11 11:36:36","comment":null,"excerpt":"Your skills.

A hard-working but disrespected worker (whether an online freelancer or an actual factory worker) struggles because they’re not seen as owning enough.
