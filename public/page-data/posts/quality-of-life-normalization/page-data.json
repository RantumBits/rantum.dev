Going into any crowd requires accepting a higher degree of risk, and many activities are off limits, especially with young kids.</p>\n<p>Restaurants are outdoor-only. Movie theaters and museums are closed. Plane travel is restricted and brings new risks protocols. There’s’ no visiting friends’ and families homes, no babysitter for a night, or visits with grandparents. Work is more difficult to come by. Schedules have been upended. The fire and smoke make it all that much worse, taking away the respite and space of the outdoors.</p>\n<p>There’s no clear point of improvement on the horizon; it will come with patience and perseverance. Much has been lost in terms of quality of life. This cannot become the new standard.
