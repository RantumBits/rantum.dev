(Scot Tucker / SFBay.ca)\nThe region may see a modicum of relief on Thursday and Friday but air quality is expected to remain hazy for the foreseeable future, Roselius said.\n\nThe BAAQMD extended its Spare the Air alerts through Wednesday, marking 30 consecutive days of alerts in the Bay Area.\n\nBefore this summer, the region’s previous record for consecutive Spare the Air alert days was 13 during the 2018 Camp Fire. During Spare the Air Alert days, burning wood and other solid fuels is illegal indoors and outdoors in the Bay Area’s nine counties.\n\nResidents are advised to continue staying indoors whenever possible to protect their respiratory health. Vehicle and air conditioning systems should be set to re-circulate air rather than cycle in unhealthy air from outside.\n\n","title":"Air district calls for 30th consecutive Spare the Air Alert – SFBay","url":"https://sfbayca.com/2020/09/14/air-district-calls-for-30th-consecutive-spare-the-air-alert/","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"83ba441c-4aa1-5e78-b75f-3c2a0df6a0c2","nextid":1600124799,"previousid":1600120501}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
