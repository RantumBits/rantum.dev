I think it is the right location,&#8221; said Councilman Ricardo Ortiz, during the meeting Monday, Oct. 20.\nBut he balanced that support against concerns that the project could generate traffic and parking issues in the neighborhood, a sentiment shared by his colleagues as well.\nVice Mayor Ann O&#8217;Brien Keighran cited much more significant reservations regarding the traffic management plan proposed for the project, and suggested officials design some format for assuring compliance.\n&#8220;There has to be accountability,&#8221; said O&#8217;Brien.\nIn recognition of those concerns, City Attorney Kathleen Kane said officials will review the city&#8217;s code to identify mechanisms available to enforce potential violations of the plan designed to mitigate neighborhood traffic and parking problems.\nCouncilmembers agreed to postpone a decision on the project until a later meeting, when officials can clarify the potential enforcement outlets.\nPlans call for spreading the 60 residential units across the top two floors of the project, above four floors of office space and a lobby at the ground floor. The project is slated to offer 385 parking spaces in an underground parking lot plus about 18,000 square feet of open space. There will be three affordable units reserved for low-income tenants.\nObserving the size and scope of the project, Councilman Michael Brownrigg expressed his dissatisfaction with the public amenities offered in return for allowing greater density and height.\n&#8220;I have deep concerns with the rules that allow the project to come to us in this state,&#8221; said Brownrigg.\nThe public benefits offered in the project &#8212; the three affordable units and a public plaza &#8212; are not equivalent to the value for the city that developer Mario Muzzi received in roughly two additional two stories of development, said Brownrigg.\n\nLooking ahead, Brownrigg said he believed officials should consider refining policies which grant the city greater bargaining power when considering community assets in return for additional development density.\n&#8220;I strongly believe we need to look at the balance of benefits and concessions and put our finger more on the scale for housing &#8212; and affordable housing in particular,&#8221; said Brownrigg.\nWhile expressing his frustration, Brownrigg noted the development proposed adhered to the existing rules and lauded elements of its design.\n&#8220;I appreciate the quality of work. It looks pretty elegant. I like that there are two stories of housing. But it troubles me that we don&#8217;t have more housing,&#8221; he said.\nO&#8217;Brien maintained a different perspective, suggesting officials have approved a slate of residential development that is yet to be built at a time when housing prices are dropping throughout the Bay Area amid the pandemic.\n&#8220;It is becoming so much more affordable. I would hate to see a glut of housing and it not be filled,&#8221; she said.\nFor her part, Mayor Emily Beach sensed that a majority of her colleagues felt the project was ready to advance once officials returned with more details regarding the city&#8217;s ability to enforce compliance on the transportation plan.\n&#8220;I think this is a good project,&#8221; she said.\nIn other business, officials unanimously approved spending $59,000 for an analysis of park trees with 4-foot circumference, as well as the city&#8217;s stock of mature eucalyptus trees.\nThe approval comes weeks after a San Mateo woman was killed in Washington Park when a limb fell from a cedar tree. Three others who were picnicking with woman were hospitalized in the tragedy as well.\nWith hopes of preventing future accidents, officials supported the proposal to examine an additional nearly 2,000 trees.\n&#8220;With the tragedy at Washington Park, I think we were all mortified by it,&#8221; said Ortiz.\naustin@smdailyjournal.com\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \n    \n\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                ","title":"Admiration but inaction for Burlingame development | Local News","url":"https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/admiration-but-inaction-for-burlingame-development/article_ba85da3a-14e0-11eb-b48a-5bb5f347611d.html","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"1c8681f0-7638-57a0-a22a-8d5f6ab48789","nextid":1603404254,"previousid":1603439820}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
