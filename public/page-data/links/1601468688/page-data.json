Opponents of the measure are also convinced fewer and fewer people will use Caltrain moving forward in part because of the advent of work-from-home policies. &#160;\nIf approved by two thirds of the voters in San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, the tax will generate an estimated $108 million annually for 30 years. Caltrain currently gets the majority of its funding from fares along with contributions from the three counties it serves.\n\nWith ridership down 95% since the onset of the pandemic, Caltrain is facing an $18 million budget deficit that will deepen if riders don&#8217;t soon return. Only federal CARES Act funding is keeping the trains running and that money is quickly running out, officials say.\n&#8220;If we don&#8217;t have the sales tax we&#8217;re out of revenue and we&#8217;ll very likely have to stop the passenger service or radically reduce it,&#8221; said Dave Pine, the chair of Caltrain&#8217;s board of directors and also a San Mateo County supervisor. &#8220;It&#8217;s very much an existential threat to the railroad.&#8221;\nWithout Caltrain, residents can expect traffic congestion to be worse than it was before the pandemic, proponents of the measure argue.\n&#8220;Voting yes on RR will remove thousands of cars from our highways every day,&#8221; reads the official ballot argument against the measure. &#8220;Without Caltrain, traffic congestion will soon be worse than before COVID-19.&#8221;\nBut opponents believe Caltrain ridership will never return to prepandemic rates given the rising popularity of working from home. &#160;&#160;\n&#8220;Prepandemic levels they will never get back to,&#8221; said Jim Lawrence, a former Foster City mayor who wrote the ballot argument against the measure. &#8220;Every major corporation is saying they now work remotely. Many are even moving out of the Bay Area. So we&#8217;re not going to have this mass influx every day going up and down the Peninsula. It&#8217;s just not going to happen.&#8221;\nMeasure RR supporters, on the other hand, are confident ridership will return to prepandemic levels. That&#8217;s in part because there remains &#8220;strong interest&#8221; in development in the region and because telecommuting will not be as widespread as Lawrence believes, according to Don Cecil, with the San Mateo County Economic Development Association, or SAMCEDA.\n&#8220;When we talk to major employers yes they&#8217;ve made decisions like allowing employees to work from home permanently or allowing them to work from home until next June, but no one envisions a complete telecommute environment that I&#8217;m speaking with,&#8221; Cecil said.\nAdina Levin of the nonprofit Friends of Caltrain noted recent polling found 70% of people who were frequent users of Caltrain plan on using the railroad as much or more than before the pandemic.\n&#8220;The surveys of individuals also show people are planning to come back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People who are working from home while their small children run around in the background and they&#8217;re hearing maybe their housemate talk on the phone on their other Zoom call are eager to get back to the office.&#8221;\nLawrence also cited the regressive nature of sales taxes and the ongoing financial crisis as reasons to reject the Caltrain tax proposal.\n\n&#8220;Regressive taxes impact the lowest end of our economy and households the worst with no direct benefit back to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[Caltrain] is expensive, it&#8217;s not convenient for them and very few use it. &#8230; Why should the general public pay for something that less than 1% of the community uses?&#8221;\n&#8220;Riders of Caltrain are the upper end of the economy,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Household incomes [among riders] are approaching $200,000.&#8221;\nLevin countered 30% of Caltrain riders are considered low-income.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s not true that Caltrain is all affluent riders,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s 30% of people who are low-income who have been using the service historically. Also that is disproportionately lower than the share of low-income people who live near the corridor and work on the corridor. By making Caltrain more affordable, there are people that would be able to take advantage of that.&#8221;\nPine said &#8220;making Caltrain accessible to more riders is a key element of Measure RR.&#8221;\n&#8220;Fundamentally when you&#8217;re able to offer more service on different schedules it opens up the railway to a host of different types of riders,&#8221; he said, noting when electrification is complete in 2022, service will go from 92 trains per day to 168 trains per day. &#8220;That&#8217;s big growth and Measure RR helps to pay some of those operating expenses to get there.&#8221;\nPine also referenced a soon-to-launch pilot program offering 50% fare reductions to low-income riders.\n&#8220;To maintain that, Measure RR will be a big help,&#8221; he said.\nMark Hinkle of the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association said voters are being inundated with tax hikes at a time when many are out of work.\n&#8220;If you add up all the taxes that are going to be on the ballot in November it&#8217;s over $5 billion in tax increases at a time when people are being laid off, furloughed or working part time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Talking about kicking someone when they&#8217;re down. It&#8217;s absolutely the wrong time for a tax increase.&#8221;\nOn the other hand, the official ballot argument in favor of the Caltrain tax describes it as a &#8220;small price to pay&#8221; to save the railroad. &#160;\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall victim to the naysayers&#8217; scare tactics,&#8221; the argument reads. &#8220;Measure RR only adds one penny to an $8 purchase and essentials like groceries and medicine are exempt. That&#8217;s a small price to pay to prevent traffic congestion and save Caltrain.&#8221;\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \n    \n\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                ","title":"Measure RR seeks to save, grow Caltrain in San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties","url":"https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/measure-rr-seeks-to-save-grow-caltrain-in-san-mateo-san-francisco-and-santa-clara/article_d24c3e22-02d2-11eb-97f1-93a5fc8a2932.html","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"9c0b3f71-f53e-5e48-8758-9dd61f9390f3","nextid":1601432793,"previousid":1601478611}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
