Weiss are set to adapt the hit book trilogy for Netflix. The Senators&#8217; accuse the streamer of &#8220;normalizing&#8221; China&#8217;s extra-judicial detention of over one million Muslims in Xinjiang, referencing past comments from the books&#8217; author Liu Cixin supporting the program.\nFact #1: The Three Body Problem book trilogy by Liu Cixin is a fantastic work of art. \nIMO it&#8217;s the most important work of science fiction since Asimov&#8217;s Foundation trilogy back in the 1950s, and I&#8217;m thrilled that Netflix is adapting it into a television/movie series (less thrilled that Benioff and Weiss are the guys in charge).\nFact #2: Liu Cixin is not outspoken on politics, but when he does speak, he is a non-apologetic apologist for the Chinese government&#8217;s brutal treatment of its Uyghur minority population.\nHere&#8217;s the quote that everyone focuses on, from a June, 2019 feature article in the New Yorker:\nWhen I brought up the mass internment of Muslim&#160;Uighurs&#8212;around a million are now in re-education camps in the northwestern province of Xinjiang&#8212;he trotted out the familiar arguments of government-controlled media: &#8220;Would you rather that they be hacking away at bodies at train stations and schools in terrorist attacks? If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty.&#8221; The answer duplicated government propaganda so exactly that I couldn&#8217;t help asking Liu if he ever thought he might have been brainwashed. &#8220;I know what you are thinking,&#8221; he told me with weary clarity. &#8220;What about individual liberty and freedom of governance?&#8221; He sighed, as if exhausted by a debate going on in his head. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not what Chinese people care about. For ordinary folks, it&#8217;s the cost of health care, real-estate prices, their children&#8217;s education. Not democracy.&#8221;\nFact #3: Yesterday, five GOP Senators sent a letter to Netflix, saying that any adaptation of Liu Cixin&#8217;s work amounted to &#8220;normalization&#8221; of China&#8217;s actions against the Uyghurs, and that &#8220;Netflix&#8217;s decision to do business with an individual who is parroting dangerous CCP propaganda&#8221; amounts to &#8220;complicity&#8221; with the CCP.\nYou can download a PDF copy of the letter here.\nThe surface issue around these facts, of course, is whether artists are separable from their art.\nDoes the recognition and promotion of good art made by artists with abhorrent political opinions serve also to recognize and promote those abhorrent political opinions?\nMy answer is yes &#8230; if you&#8217;re a rhinoceros.\nBut if you&#8217;re still a human being &#8230; if you&#8217;re still able to hold two independent thoughts in your head at the same time &#8230; if you&#8217;re still able to believe that yes, China&#8217;s treatment of the Uyghurs is a grotesque evil deserving of implacable sanction and resistance AND yes, The Three Body Problem is an important work of art &#8230; then my answer is no.\nTo be sure, there is a spectrum of association between artist and abhorrent regime that plays a crucial role in how I&#8217;m answering this question. I mean, no one needs to be doing a Leni Riefenstahl retrospective in 1938. That said, I don&#8217;t think that any reasonable person could say that Liu Cixin is an unofficial spokesperson for the Chinese government like Riefenstahl was for Germany, and I definitely don&#8217;t think that any reasonable person could say that The Three Body Problem is a glorification of the grotesque Chinese state like Triumph of the Will was a glorification of the grotesque German state.\nIt is, of course, possible for well-meaning people to disagree on this question.\nBut I don&#8217;t think that the five GOP Senators who sent this letter to Netflix are well-meaning.\nI don&#8217;t think these Senators care very much about this book adaptation and the indirect-at-best &#8220;normalization&#8221; of abhorrent political views held by the author of the source material. I don&#8217;t think that this letter was written out of a deep and abiding concern with the horrific treatment of the Uyghurs, because if that were true a letter to Mary Barra at General Motors might be just a wee bit more relevant and impactful.\nNo, I think this letter was written out of a deep and abiding concern with Netflix.\nI think this letter was written to generate a &#8220;Whatabout?&#8221; talking point regarding Netflix in particular and Hollywood in general, so that any criticism of these GOP Senators and Dear Leader on the China political dimension can be blunted, and any attacks on the political opponents of these GOP Senators and Dear Leader on the China political dimension can be buttressed.\nI think that&#8217;s why this letter was written NOW.\nWhich leads me to the best advice I&#8217;ve got for maintaining a critical distance from the barrage of Fiat News that seeks to weld our minds shut, to the best advice I&#8217;ve got for maintaining some resistance to our hard-wired tendency to fall into Gell-Mann Amnesia.\nWhenever you read something in the news, always ask yourself:\nClear eyes. Full hearts. Can&#8217;t lose.\n\n\n\n","title":"Why Am I Reading This Now?","url":"https://www.epsilontheory.com/why-am-i-reading-this-now-2/","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"d42694ef-141d-5959-8471-a1e6c586e0f5","nextid":1601033517,"previousid":1600960083}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
