There were scenes of frantic evacuations out of eastern Santa Rosa Sunday night and early Monday morning, including one involving hundreds of elderly people — some in wheel chairs or with walkers — out of the Oakmont senior community along Highway 12.\nThe Glass Fire began around 4 a.m. Sunday in an area east of Highway 29 and north of St. Helena. Evacuations proceeded throughout the day in Napa County, and evacuation orders for areas of Sonoma County did not arrive until evening on Sunday as the two spot fires south and west of the Glass Fire began growing rapidly and tearing over the ridge between the counties. The combined fires have burned 11,000 acres as of Monday morning.\nAs ABC 7 reports, homes and wineries appeared to be damaged in the Deer Park area of Napa County, and an uncertain number of homes were destroyed overnight in Santa Rosa, in particular around Oakmont and Skyhawk areas.\nThe Chronicle spoke with Sonoma County Supervisor Susan Gorin, who lost her home in Oakmont in the 2017 Nuns Fire, and she's still in the process of reconstructing it. She isn't sure if it will survive and says, &quot;It’s like God has no sympathy, no empathy for Sonoma County.&quot;\nEvacuation orders as of Monday extended to the eastern edge of Coffey Park, the neighborhood that was decimated in the Tubbs Fire three years ago, and south to Glen Ellen, where the Nuns Fire began. The full list of evacuation orders with links is here.\nMap via Press DemocratParts of St. Helena and Calistoga remain under evacuation orders and warnings as well, as the Napa Valley Register reports.\nAround 6,000 homes and structures remain under threat, according to Cal Fire.\nSome wineries and wine country businesses are already reported to have sustained damage, including Chateau Boswell and The Black Rock Inn in St. Helena, per the Associated Press.\nA Red Flag Warning, with expected high wind gusts at higher elevations, remains in effect until 9 p.m. Monday.\n","title":"Glass Fire Merges With Sonoma Fire, Burns 11,000 Acres and Prompts Mass Evacuation","url":"https://sfist.com/2020/09/28/glass-fire-merges-with-sonoma-fire-burns-11-000/","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"f324f0a1-26df-5b50-bfd5-03b2aba70001","nextid":1600960083,"previousid":1601323009}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
