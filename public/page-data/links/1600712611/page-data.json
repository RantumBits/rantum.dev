As KPIX reports, police say they're getting an increasing number of reports of burglaries being committed through garage doors — and North Beach resident Ginny Fang tells the station, &quot;You take a walk down the neighborhood and you see so many holes just punched into garages.&quot;\nSome thieves have been seen on surveillance video, but many are accessing homes and stealing bicycles out of garages, and more. And one of Fang's neighbors shared a homemade map they've created documenting 50 recent burglaries in what appears to be about a 10-block radius.\nTwo weeks ago, the SFPD said that three suspects had been arrested in connection with three separate North Beach burglaries, and they appeared to be working as a team. All three men are San Francisco residents, and at least one was wanted on several unrelated burglary warrants, as KPIX reported.\nCrime has generally trended downward since the pandemic began, with decreases in most violent crimes in San Francisco. Homicides were up 21 percent in the city as of June, as the Chronicle previously reported, but rapes, assaults, and larceny crimes were all down by double-digit percentages. For the period between March and June, burglaries were up 53.6 percent citywide, and while the citywide figure is now about 10 points lower with the period of June to September is added in, the trend continues.\nThere's also been an ongoing uptick in auto thefts in SF — a trend that has been echoed in other major cities around the U.S. as more people leave cars on the street for days and weeks on end.
