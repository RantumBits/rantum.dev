A fourth group of students opted for all-remote learning.\n\r\nHalf of the twice-a-week students will be allowed to return to school Oct. 19 and the other half Oct. 22, as long as Nantucket has fallen from a red coronavirus designation to yellow or lower, Hallett said. Red districts indicate communities with an average daily coronavirus positivity rate of eight or more cases per 100,000 people over a two-week period.\n\r\nHallett, along with town, hospital and health department officials, were all in favor of the hybrid model starting Thursday (Click here for story).\n\r\nThey also consider the state data skewed because the state is using Nantucket's 2010 Census population of 11,000 when calculating the positivity rate. Town health director Roberto Santamaria put the island&#8217;s population at closer to 17,000 based on estimates from the Nantucket Data Platform.\n\r\n&#8220;My hope would have been that (Riley) and his team would have looked carefully at the real data we provide and would have considered that,&#8221; Hallett said. &#8220;But I understand the importance of making sure everyone is safe and currently Nantucket is a red designation so we must respect that.&#8221;\n\r\nThere have been 62 confirmed coronavirus cases on the island in the last 20 days, 21 in the last seven days and 126 on Nantucket since testing began in mid-March.\n\r\nClick here&#160;to sign up for &#8220;Above the Fold,&#8221; The Inquirer and Mirror&#8217;s twice-weekly newsletter, bringing you both the news and a slice of island life, curated with content created by Nantucket&#8217;s only team of professionally-trained journalists.\n\r\nFor up-to-the-minute information on Nantucket&#8217;s breaking news, boat and plane cancellations, weather alerts, sports and entertainment news, deals and promotions at island businesses and more, Sign up for Inquirer and Mirror text alerts.&#160;Click Here\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t","title":"State: Nantucket schools can't resume in-class learning for all students Oct. 1","url":"https://www.ack.net/news/20200929/state-nantucket-schools-cant-resume-in-class-learning-for-all-students-oct-1","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"836b37b5-c481-549a-9ea4-0beb384d30ed","nextid":1601303080,"previousid":1601468688}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
