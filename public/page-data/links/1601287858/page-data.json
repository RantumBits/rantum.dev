And more homes in Santa Rosa were burning once again.\nAfter the Glass Fire ignited early Sunday morning and burned in the northern part of Napa Valley east of Calistoga, two more fires appeared Sunday evening to the south and west of that fire, the Shady Fire and the Boysen Fire. The Shady Fire spread quickly within a few hours, moving into the eastern portion of Santa Rosa and prompting widespread evacuation orders.\nAs the Chronicle reports, evacuation orders included a large senior community called Oakmont Village along Highway 12 in Sonoma County, south of Santa Rosa. \nGridlock was reported on Highway 12 for those trying to head west, toward the city of Santa Rosa, and evacuees were being warned to head east instead.\nMap via Press DemocratMore than 10,000 residents of Santa Rosa were forced to flee the fire zone Sunday night and into Monday morning, as the Press Democrat reports. And high winds were forecast to continue for at least several hours.\nReportedly, houses were already burned Monday morning in the Skyhawk neighborhood, in Oakmont, and on Melita Road.\nHomes burn off Hwy 12 near Oakmont during Shady fire @NorthBayNews pic.twitter.com/a634KSfDOr\n— Beth Schlanker (@BethSchlanker) September 28, 2020 #ShadyFire crossing Highway 12 NW of Valero. #BREAKING #BreakingNews pic.twitter.com/oXHsDkAm1k\n— Anne Belden (@abelden) September 28, 2020 The Glass Fire continued to spread through Sunday and had consumed at least 2,500 acres as of midnight.
