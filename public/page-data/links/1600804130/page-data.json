Malls and all indoor retail will be permitted to operate at 50% capacity while gyms and fitness centers will be allowed to open at 10% capacity.\n\nAfter remaining in the purple tier for three weeks, the county maintained having fewer than seven new daily cases per 100,000 residents and maintained a positive test rate below 8% for two weeks. Currently, the county has 6.8 new cases for every 100,000 residents and a positivity rate of 4.5%, according to the state&#8217;s Blueprint for a Safer Economy COVID-19 dashboard.\nFor school to reopen, the county must remain in the red tier for two consecutive weeks. The county will also have to remain in the red tier for at least three consecutive weeks before moving into the next less restrictive orange tier. To enter the orange &#8220;moderate&#8221; tier, the county will have to maintain a positivity rate below 4.9% while also reporting 3.9 or fewer new cases per 100,000 residents for two consecutive weeks.\n&#8220;This remains far from over,&#8221; said San Mateo County&#8217;s Health Officer Dr. Scott Morrow. &#8220;To get out of this situation depends on all of us. Our collective best course of action: No gatherings outside of immediate households, use facial coverings extensively, and social distancing.&#8221;\n\n\r\n                                \r\n                                \r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n                            \n    \n\r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                ","title":"County moves out of most restrictive tier","url":"https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/county-moves-out-of-most-restrictive-tier/article_7ae5ba96-fd0a-11ea-93f9-bbbc030c24c9.html","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"15b1cb83-ed55-55d1-a6a6-648068c73a28","nextid":1600724034,"previousid":1600884377}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
