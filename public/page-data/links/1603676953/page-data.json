To the south, Boulder Creek has no power. Half Moon Bay has power but the lights were out at the city limits to the east.\n\nNo power shutoffs were planned in Palo Alto including the city&#8217;s hills.\n\nHere&#8217;s a link to PG&amp;E&#8217;s information about the outages.\n\nMore intentional outages are expected on Monday as the Bay Area braces for a return of gusty winds and bone-dry weather that carry the threat of downing or fouling power lines or other equipment, which in recent years have been blamed for igniting massive and deadly blazes.\n\nForests are dryer than they were in previous decades because a lack of forest management has resulted in more vegetation growing unchecked, which competes for the same amount of underground water. Also, dead vegetation is no longer removed from forests, providing additional fuel for wildfires.\n\nIt&#8217;s the fifth time this year that PG&amp;E has cut power to customers. Power was shut off yesterday for 117,000 customers in 18 Northern California counties including San Mateo and Santa Clara, and outages were expected to continue, affecting as many as 361,000 customers in all.\n\nEach customer represents two to three people, so more than 1 million Californians could be without power because of the planned shutoffs.\n\nFurther south, Southern California Edison said it was considering safety outages for 71,000 customers in six counties starting today.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for the entire Bay Area and much of the state through 11 a.m. Monday, predicting winds of up to 35 mph in lower elevations and 80 mph in some mountainous areas.\n\nThe concern is that any spark could be blown into flames sweeping through tinder-dry brush and forestland. The areas of greatest risk include the Sacramento Valley and mountainous areas of Southern California, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe conditions could equal those during devastating fires in California&#8217;s wine country in 2017 and last year&#8217;s Kincade Fire, the National Weather Service said. Fire officials said PG&amp;E transmission lines sparked that Sonoma County fire last October, which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly 100,000 people to flee. &#8212; From staff and wire reports\n\n\t","title":"Planned power outages start in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties","url":"https://padailypost.com/2020/10/25/planned-power-outages-start-in-santa-clara-and-san-mateo-counties/","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"20fb2130-a0d4-59df-baaa-529941475e81","nextid":1603439820,"previousid":1603853318}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
