Testing would be available by appointment, with results available in 15 minutes, and the airline hoped the $250 price point would come down in the near future. \n\nSince then Hawaiian Airlines also announced same day airport testing coming for its passengers for $150. The State of Hawaii plans to allow people to enter the state without 14 day quarantine starting October 15, provided they present a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours of arrival. United says the state will accept their Abbott rapid tests.\n\nNow Oakland airport is announcing that its Hawaii passengers can get rapid tests for free starting October 15.\n\n\nThe testing program opens to airport and airline employees starting October 6, and to passengers October 15.\n\nTests are by appointment and the location of CityHealth Urgent Care, which will perform the tests, is at the airport’s North Field terminal which is on the opposite side of the airport from passenger terminals. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAccording to the airport, OAK recommends that travelers test the day before. If travelers wait until the day of departure, they should arrive three hours before departure, get tested (have the results in 15 minutes which are electronically sent to the State of Hawaii) and then check-in for their flight.\nNon-stop flights to Hawaii from Oakland are offered by Southwest Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. Many passengers can get testing with no out of pocket cost through other providers, using their insurance or public health resources, but at-airport testing makes the travel process more convenient and rapid testing addresses frequent delays of lab results.\n\nFor a family of four or five, free tests versus $150 to $250 per person, could serve as a competitive advantage for Oakland airport as a departure point for Hawaii travel versus San Francisco. Nearby San Jose airport says they’re exploring their own testing program, too.\n\nThese efforts are so far limited to Hawaii, but don’t expect it to stay that way. In October Tampa is trialing offering testing to all passengers and expects a $125 price point.\n\nWidespread testing give confidence to numerous destinations to allow in passengers without quarantine, and if an airline made testing mandatory to travel they’d give confidence to all passengers on board that everyone had tested negative for the virus – and that could reduce anxiety over travel significantly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"The Testing Wars Have Begun: Oakland Airport Wants To Attract Passengers With Free Rapid Covid Testing - View from the Wing","url":"https://viewfromthewing.com/the-testing-wars-have-begun-oakland-airport-wants-to-attract-passengers-with-free-rapid-covid-testing/","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"bc64128c-f0a1-5848-bc60-a41363f4cfaf","nextid":1601478611,"previousid":1601927508}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
