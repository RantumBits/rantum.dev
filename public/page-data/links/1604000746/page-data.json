This year has been a fruitful year.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nLepore,&#160;a physician and surgeon at Nantucket&#160;Cottage&#160;Hospital and one of the&#160;nation's&#160;foremost tick-borne-disease expects, said he doesn&#8217;t consider this year&#8217;s numbers an aberration yet. The number of positive Lyme disease cases vary from year to year, but if he were to see 200 or more cases by the end of the year, it would be reason for concern, he added.&#160;\n\r\nA number of factors could be contributing to the rise in cases this year, said Elizabeth Harris, Nantucket Cottage Hospital&#8217;s infection prevention manager. The increased numbers of people spending time outdoors, and the larger footprint that deer have had &#160;around the island this spring are the two primary reasons, she believes.&#160;\n\r\n&#8220;When all of this (COVID-19) stuff started happening, everything was pretty much shut down on the island,\" Harris said.&#160;&#8220;When I would go to work in the morning, I would see no cars, but would see deer walking around like they owned the road. There were deer everywhere.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nThere was also increased public use of the island&#8217;s open spaces, as people walked and biked when much of the downtown area was shut down and stay-at-home advisories were in effect. The trend continued in the summer with&#160;an abundance of sunny days, she said.&#160;\n\r\nDeer are&#160;essential in the life cycle of the blacklegged tick (also known as the deer tick) that carries Lyme disease. Although the ticks&#160; feed on smaller mammals&#160;like rodents, in order&#160;to obtain the protein necessary for laying&#160;eggs, they must find a more substantial &#8220;blood meal,&#8221; and in the majority of cases, deer&#160;are the perfect host.&#160;Wherever you see deer on-island, there is a good chance ticks will be there as well.\n\r\n&#8220;The ticks need deer blood to successfully&#160;reproduce,&#8221; Lepore said.&#160;&#8220;If you kill off the deer, you would see a&#160;fall-off&#160;in the tick-borne diseases.&#8221;&#160;&#160;\n\r\nAccording to the Nantucket Historical Association, deer&#160;were imported to Nantucket&#160;in the 1920s,&#160;and without any natural predators on the island, their numbers grew exponentially.\n\r\n&#8220;There are no bears, no cougars, no coyotes, all they have to do is watch out for the Range Rovers,&#8221; Lepore said.&#160;&#8220;If they look both ways before they cross the street, and move into (no trespassing areas) during hunting season, they&#8217;ll live a good long time.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nKey symptoms of Lyme disease, a bacterial infection that can spread to the joints, heart and nervous system,&#160;are similar to the common cold and include fever, chills,&#160;muscle aches, headache and&#160;fatigue.&#160;The symptoms are&#160;also&#160;similar&#160;to those of coronavirus, but Harris doesn&#8217;t think that has led to increased testing, and as a result an increase in positive results.&#160;\n\r\n&#8220;On one hand people are&#160;extremely&#160;worked up about COVID and interested in testing, but at the same&#160;time&#160;people don&#8217;t really want to come to the hospital unless they absolutely have to,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#8220;So,&#160;I think it kind of balances out. I think it really comes down to people being out&#160;in&#160;nature&#160;more.&#8221;&#160;\n\r\nHarris said she has found a common theme among those tested for Lyme disease this year. Not very many are checking themselves for ticks after being outdoors.&#160;For maximum protection, the hospital recommendation is to wear light-colored, full-length clothing and tuck your pants into your socks. But&#160;during the hot summer months, that was something few were willing to do.&#160;\n\r\n&#8220;It might be the ultimate dorky look but it&#8217;s better than getting Lyme disease,&#8221; Lepore said.&#160;\n\r\nHarris recommends&#160;thoroughly&#160;checking for ticks&#160;after being outdoors. That means checking everywhere,&#160;especially in spots you might not think to look, like&#160;behind the&#160;knees, under the armpits&#160;and on the head. If people just took that simple precaution after being outdoors, it would&#160;eliminate a lot of potential cases, Harris said.&#160;\n\r\nTick season on Nantucket runs from&#160;spring into&#160;the fall&#160;and the peak is during the summer months, when people are most often outdoors.&#160;But because there is a delay of a few weeks from a&#160;tick bite&#160;to when symptoms of a&#160;tick-borne illness&#160;appear, Harris said many of the cases come in during the early fall.&#160;\n\r\nAnaplasmosis, another tick-borne illness, is also trending up this year, with 15 total cases after only two cases reported to the state last year, Harris said. But babesiosis is in line with case numbers from last year: 26 by mid-August, compared to 41 all of last year. But many of the cases of babesiosis show up later in the fall, so Harris said the island is still on pace to match or surpass&#160;last year&#8217;s totals.&#160;\n\r\nThe tick population isn&#8217;t spread evenly throughout the island. Known hot spots include the State Forest and the area around the UMass field station in Quaise.&#160;Ticks don&#8217;t like direct sunlight and are often found in&#160; shaded,&#160;moist&#160;areas around the edges of brush.&#160;\n\r\n&#160;\n\r\nClick here&#160;to sign up for &#8220;Above the Fold,&#8221; The Inquirer and Mirror&#8217;s twice-weekly newsletter, bringing you both the news and a slice of island life, curated with content created by Nantucket&#8217;s only team of professionally-trained journalists.\n\r\nFor up-to-the-minute information on Nantucket&#8217;s breaking news, boat and plane cancellations, weather alerts, sports and entertainment news, deals and promotions at island businesses and more, Sign up for Inquirer and Mirror text alerts.&#160;Click Here\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t","title":"Lyme disease cases spiking on Nantucket this year","url":"https://www.ack.net/news/20201029/lyme-disease-cases-spiking-on-nantucket-this-year","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"37f7f528-4892-58fb-9cd0-1103a3e8ead4","nextid":1603853318,"previousid":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
