That means his Martha&#8217;s Vineyard boys cross country team wouldn&#8217;t get to defend its 2019 Division 2 All-State championship, the first in program history.\n&#8220;There was a feeling that we should prove to people that even after losing a couple seniors last year, we were still going to be competitive in the postseason,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Repeating would&#8217;ve been awesome.&#8221;\nRichards, now a senior, faces the reality of not only not getting another shot at a title, but not even getting to race against an opposing team. The Martha&#8217;s Vineyard School Committee voted Monday to offer only intramural athletics this fall, withdrawing the Vineyarders from all interscholastic competition.\nNantucket announced a similar decision Thursday afternoon.\n&#8220;Whatever the School Committee chose was the best choice for the kids to keep us safe, but it is unfortunate that we&#8217;re not able to run,&#8221; girls cross country runner Eloise Christy said.\nChristy&#8217;s sister Adrienne added, &#8220;I was looking forward to it a bunch. I was training throughout the summer, and it&#8217;s a great thing to run with other people.&#8221;\nThe committee&#8217;s decision followed a recommendation from its health and safety committee that student-athletes be restricted to on-island play. The latest map from the Department of Public Health shows Martha&#8217;s Vineyard as having fewer than five total reported cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, which wiped out the spring high school season and delayed the fall preseason until today.\nA full interscholastic season would mean athletes and coaches would frequently board ferries and travel to communities with potentially higher infection rates, then return home.\n&#8220;I would&#8217;ve liked to have played, and I know our kids would like to have played, because the MIAA and the league are doing that, and we wanted to give our kids an opportunity,&#8221; Vineyard athletic director Mark McCarthy said. &#8220;The health and safety committee, and then eventually the School Committee, felt that this was the safest thing to do, and I&#8217;m not going to argue with that.&#8221;\nMcCarthy said the school hasn&#8217;t decided yet on whether to move its fall offerings to &#8220;Fall II,&#8221; the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association&#8217;s floating season that will begin Feb. 22. MIAA rules allow for schools to petition to move their fall offerings to Fall II, but McCarthy said he&#8217;s unsure who his teams would play.\nThe Cape &amp; Islands League, of which MV is a member, is still planning to compete in all sports except volleyball and football this fall. The MIAA also has recommended schools limit their schedules to in-league games.\n&#8220;There probably isn&#8217;t going to be anybody to play in Fall II,&#8221; McCarthy said. &#8220;Everybody else is playing now.&#8221;\nThe school&#8217;s decision is designed to eliminate competition off the island, but it also could result in MV student-athletes going off the island anyway for club competitions. Andrew Marchand, a league all-star in boys golf last fall, said he competed in a golf tournament in Seekonk over the summer and likely will do so again this fall.\n&#8220;A majority of the other players on our team have signed up for a bunch of Challenge Cup tournaments,&#8221; said Peter Gillis, another boys golf league all-star last fall. &#8220;As a golfer, we have less concern for the coronavirus than football or soccer, where people are more bunched up. Unfortunately, they shut it down on Monday, which was really disappointing.&#8221;\nRuby Reimann, a girls soccer goalkeeper and all-star for the Vineyard last fall, also will play elsewhere this fall. Thursday was her first practice with the Seacoast United club team, but she said she&#8217;ll still participate in whatever intramural activities there are.\n&#8220;We are allowed some kind of play, and I think that&#8217;s something that we have to think positively about,&#8221; Reimann said. &#8220;Sports provide a really good structure for students, whether it&#8217;s friendships, lessons, how to compete, a lot of valuable lessons that you can&#8217;t be taught through a computer. I think that&#8217;s important for kids right now, especially now that we&#8217;re spending most of our day at home.&#8221;\nNantucket&#8217;s decision came following the latest DPH update, which classified Nantucket as a &#8220;red&#8221; zone, with more than eight reported cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 population over the past two weeks. Schools in red zones can compete only at the intramural level, athletic director Chris Maury said, leading to an intramural Whalers season tentatively scheduled to begin Oct. 1.\n&#8220;Much as I would like to, and have worked to, give our kids an opportunity to get back on the athletic fields for interscholastic play this fall, I do not feel that playing at an interscholastic level is the right decision for our student-athletes and/or that it is fair to all of the other league member schools to ask for Nantucket to remain on any of the 2020 fall game schedules,&#8221; Maury said in a statement announced via social media. &#8221;The best decision regarding our NPS fall athletic teams is to pull all of our teams out of any interscholastic play for the 2020 fall season and focus on developing an on-island intramural-based approach for this year's NPS fall athletic teams.&#8221;\n&#160;\n&#160;\n&#160;\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t","title":"High schools: Marthas Vineyard, Nantucket go intramural for the fall","url":"https://www.capecodtimes.com/sports/20200917/high-schools-marthas-vineyard-nantucket-go-intramural-for-fall","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"398c28e4-c5df-5232-96f7-e85b182ac995","nextid":1600274315,"previousid":1600399168}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
