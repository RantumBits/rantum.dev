He cautions that societal collapse can feel quite normal for many people — but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t happening. I Lived Through Collapse.

It’s already fallen down.\n\nTags: Indi Samarajiva   politics   USA","title":"The Unsettling Normalcy of Societal Collapse","url":"https://kottke.org/20/09/the-unsettling-normalcy-of-societal-collapse","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"be01838a-219b-526e-92bd-802d22501c9e","nextid":1601294903,"previousid":1601432793}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
