But with powerful telescopes, they have detected a chemical — phosphine — in the thick Venus atmosphere. After much analysis, the scientists assert that something now alive is the only explanation for the chemical’s source.\n\nSome researchers question this hypothesis, and they suggest instead that the gas could result from unexplained atmospheric or geologic processes on a planet that remains mysterious. But the finding will also encourage some planetary scientists to ask whether humanity has overlooked a planet that may have once been more Earthlike than any other world in our solar system.\n\n“This is an astonishing and ‘out of the blue’ finding,” said Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an author of the papers (one published in Nature Astronomy and another submitted to the journal Astrobiology). “It will definitely fuel more research into the possibilities for life in Venus’s atmosphere.”\n\nTags: astronomy   science   Venus","title":"Scientists Detect Signs of Possible Life on Venus","url":"https://kottke.org/20/09/scientists-detect-signs-of-possible-life-on-venus","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"03851c6f-ac75-5019-96ce-bfb4851d91b5","nextid":1599846965,"previousid":1600103714}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
