Last Thursday, she uploaded video of her playing the part and even added onto it by filling out the track with a few of her trademark screams of joy.\n\n\nObviously, the only way to increase the battle&#8217;s stakes was for Grohl to write a new song in honor of Bushell&#8217;s indomitable spirit. \n\n\nAfter admitting his child rival had won the first round and promising he had &#8220;something special in mind&#8221; for a follow-up, Grohl made good on his threat. &#8220;Every superhero needs a theme song,&#8221; he tweeted to Bushell. &#8220;Here&#8217;s one for you!&#8221;\n\n\n\nIn the video, Grohl and his daughters, The Grohlettes, perform a song written for Bushell. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something special for you,&#8221; he says at the beginning. &#8220;Something you&#8217;ve never heard before. Something I&#8217;ve never heard before.&#8221; The song calls Bushell the &#8220;best drummer in the world&#8221; and the &#8220;coolest on the scene&#8221; and, because Grohl&#8217;s written it as much as a tribute (not that one) as another volley in the conflict, it also includes a drum solo that Bushell will probably have mastered by her no-doubt-early bedtime tonight.\nWhat she&#8217;ll return with is anyone&#8217;s guess. Before responding to Grohl&#8217;s first challenge, Bushell showed how she prepares for battle, sharing a video of her calling upon &#8220;The Rock Gods Of Old&#8221;&#8212;John Bonham, Ginger Baker, Neil Peart, and Keith Moon&#8212;in an adorable occult ritual. With these titans behind her and a Dave Grohl theme song to her name, Bushell has obviously grown far too powerful to be contained by a single drum battle. \n\n\n [via Consequence Of Sound]\n\nSend Great Job, Internet tips to gji@theonion.com  \n","title":"Dave Grohl escalates drum battle with 10-year-old Nandi Bushell","url":"https://news.avclub.com/dave-grohl-escalates-drum-battle-with-10-year-old-nandi-1845050760","popularity":null}},"pageContext":{"id":"c4a1ea3b-e9b6-5c6c-80a8-ff4b9507622b","nextid":1600136693,"previousid":1600201801}},"staticQueryHashes":["1818862735","2119039708","2254119687","251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
