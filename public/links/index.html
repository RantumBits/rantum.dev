News</div><blockquote>Nantucket has already seen more cases of Lyme disease this year than were reported all of last year.
There have been 140 confirmed cases through the end of September, compared to 58 during the same time last year, a 143 percent increase.
There were 93 total cases in 2019.</blockquote><blockquote>There was also increased public use of the island’s open spaces, as people walked and biked when much of the downtown area was shut down and stay-at-home advisories were in effect. The trend continued in the summer with an abundance of sunny days, she said. 
Deer are essential in the life cycle of the blacklegged tick (also known as the deer tick) that carries Lyme disease. Although the ticks  feed on smaller mammals like rodents, in order to obtain the protein necessary for laying eggs, they must find a more substantial “blood meal,” and in the majority of cases, deer are the perfect host. Wherever you see deer on-island, there is a good chance ticks will be there as well.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ack.net/news/20201029/lyme-disease-cases-spiking-on-nantucket-this-year" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1603853318" alt="More businesses set to reopen as some restrictions are lifted for San Mateo County"/><a href="/links/1603853318"><h3>More businesses set to reopen as some restrictions are lifted for San Mateo County</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- --> at <!-- -->&quot;&quot;san mateo&quot; &quot; - Google News</div><blockquote>Four counties in the greater Bay Area moved into a less-restrictive coronavirus reopening tier Tuesday, allowing them to reopen more businesses and expand indoor operations for already-open businesses like restaurants and religious facilities.Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties all moved from Tier 2, the red tier, to Tier 3, the orange tier, in the state&#x27;s four-tiered reopening system following decreases in their testing positivity rates and their rates of new cases.</blockquote><blockquote>In many cases, all four counties will be able to expand the maximum capacity of indoor businesses from 25% to 50% or 200 people, whichever is fewer.Gyms, fitness centers and hotels will also be allowed to reopen indoor pools, while gyms themselves can increase their capacity from 10% to 25% of their maximum occupancy.Moving into the orange tier also allows multiple sectors like offices, cardrooms, bowling alleys, climbing walls and wineries to resume operating inside with caps on capacity. Bars, breweries and distilleries at which food is not served must continue to operate outdoors.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.almanacnews.com/news/show_story.php?id=30021" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1603676953" alt="Planned power outages start in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties"/><a href="/links/1603676953"><h3>Planned power outages start in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties</h3></a><div>This is the perspective being pushed in Palo Alto: There’s no mention of climate change as even a potential cause of drier forests, only a “lack of forest mismanagement.”  </div><div>From <!-- --> at <!-- -->&quot;&quot;san mateo&quot; &quot; - Google News</div><blockquote>Forests are dryer than they were in previous decades because a lack of forest management has resulted in more vegetation growing unchecked, which competes for the same amount of underground water.

The state agency had also determined that 114,442 of these units — or 25.9% of the total — should be designated for those in the &quot;very low&quot; income category.</blockquote><blockquote>At the same time, council members and planners recognize that the RHNA, which was once relatively easy to ignore, is starting to grow some teeth. Under Senate Bill 35, cities that fall well short of their targets in particular income categories will lose some of their power to say no to new developments in these categories. The 2017 law creates a streamlined approval process in these communities, requiring approval of housing developments within either 60 days or 90 days, depending on the number of units. In addition, these developments would be allowed to dedicate 10% of their units to below-market-rate housing, below the city&#x27;s normal standard of 15%.During an Oct. 5 discussion of the city&#x27;s newly created &quot;planned housing zone,&quot; Lait told the council that the city has an interest in meeting the SB 35 thresholds to &quot;maintain local control.&quot; Otherwise, housing developments would be approved by right, with no design review and, in some instances, with substantial breaks on parking, Lait said.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2020/10/22/bay-areas-new-growth-plan-eyes-massive-housing-influx-in-silicon-valley" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1603460121" alt="Admiration but inaction for Burlingame development | Local News"/><a href="/links/1603460121"><h3>Admiration but inaction for Burlingame development | Local News</h3></a><div>More NIMBYism on the peninsula.

The project is slated to offer 385 parking spaces in an underground parking lot plus about 18,000 square feet of open space. There will be three affordable units reserved for low-income tenants.</blockquote><blockquote>Observing the size and scope of the project, Councilman Michael Brownrigg expressed his dissatisfaction with the public amenities offered in return for allowing greater density and height.“I have deep concerns with the rules that allow the project to come to us in this state,” said Brownrigg.The public benefits offered in the project — the three affordable units and a public plaza — are not equivalent to the value for the city that developer Mario Muzzi received in roughly two additional two stories of development, said Brownrigg.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/admiration-but-inaction-for-burlingame-development/article_ba85da3a-14e0-11eb-b48a-5bb5f347611d.html" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1603404254" alt="Extreme Wind Event Arrives Early Next Week With Even Greater Potential Fire Danger, More PSPS Likely"/><a href="/links/1603404254"><h3>Extreme Wind Event Arrives Early Next Week With Even Greater Potential Fire Danger, More PSPS Likely</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- -->Jay Barmann<!-- --> at <!-- -->SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, &amp; Sports</div><blockquote>&quot;This is the fire weather forecast I was hoping wouldn&#x27;t come to pass, given all that has already transpired in 2020,&quot; says climate scientist Daniel Swain on Twitter. &quot;This will likely be strongest &amp; most widespread offshore wind event of season, [and] is reminiscent of extreme events in 2019 &amp; 2017.

The proposed calculation effectively triples the county’s previous allocation from about 16,000 units to 48,000 units.</blockquote><blockquote>Noting that housing development has lagged significantly behind the region’s economic growth, a spokesman for the regional organization said the new housing numbers are a product of an effort to make the Bay Area a more affordable, desirable and equitable place to live.“The Bay Area has not built housing to keep up with these increased employment numbers. In real life this has meant high housing costs. Both ownership and rental,” said Randy Rentschler, a spokesman for ABAG, in an email. “With respect to this RHNA cycle and recent changes in state law, the housing allocations numbers from [California Department of Housing and Community Development] are, in part, a reflection of that.”The state housing department ultimately requires the housing to be constructed, and the regional board breaks down allocations for communities throughout the Bay Area.

But for the first time in its history, it finds itself opposed by a coalition of the United States, Israel, the Arab countries, and its own people. By supporting democratic actors and anti-regime elements, this alliance can force the Islamic Republic to direct its resources to domestic security and in effect self-contain, while the bloc of anti-regime states provides external containment. Beset by internal unrest and economic strife, overextended in its costly foreign entanglements, and facing unprecedented unity from its external foes, the Islamic Republic has never looked more vulnerable. An end to the Revolutionary theocracy and the misery it has inflicted on its own people and the region since 1979 may finally be in sight.</blockquote><blockquote>The good news is that the desire to see the back of the Islamic regime has never been stronger inside Iran, and outside it, Arab states are aligning co-operatively with Israel against the regional Iranian threat. Before the pandemic, protests were more common in Iran than ever, and the regime’s mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis has made it even more unpopular. An IRGC intelligence officer who defected reports that the regime’s popularity is in single digits among Iranians, which—if true—points to a complete collapse in its popular legitimacy even among its traditional base. Demographics are working against the regime, as well. Declining birth rates indicate a concomitant decline in religion, which is bad news for a theocracy.</blockquote><p><a href="https://quillette.com/2020/10/11/the-end-of-the-islamic-republic-of-iran/" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1602373173" alt="Is China the Governance of the Future?"/><a href="/links/1602373173"><h3>Is China the Governance of the Future?</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- -->John Lloyd<!-- --> at <!-- -->Quillette</div><blockquote>This cannot all be put at the door of Trump. In his forthcoming book The Upswing, the Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam argues that Americans have lurched too far from “earlier communitarian values” in favour of individualism. He quotes the philosopher Danielle Allen:
We think we are required to choose between freedom and equality. Our choice in recent years has tipped towards freedom. Under the general influence of libertarianism, both parties have abandoned our Declaration; they have scorned our patrimony. Such a choice is dangerous. If we abandon equality, we lose the single bond that makes us a community, that makes us a people with the capacity to be free collectively and individually in the first place.</blockquote><blockquote>Taiwan, the democratic breakaway from China, is now under growing pressure, as Chinese military jets routinely overfly its airspace. “China is completely open about the threat. President Xi Jinping framed it himself in a high-profile speech in 2019: ‘We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary measures.’” If it succeeds in taking the lead from the West in the coming decades, the Chinese Communist Party will rise to global power as a tyranny with no recognition of human rights or toleration for a civil society independent of Party and state. Its success would be a turn not towards efficiency, but to a particular kind of high-tech barbarism, in which dissent is routinely silenced and ethnic and religious differences ironed out. To ignore it—worse, to succumb to it in the name of efficiency—would be to destroy democratic civilisation</blockquote><p><a href="https://quillette.com/2020/10/10/is-china-the-governance-of-the-future/" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1602175097" alt="Dr. Fauci: Earliest We’ll Be “Back to Normal” Is the End of 2021"/><a href="/links/1602175097"><h3>Dr. Fauci: Earliest We’ll Be “Back to Normal” Is the End of 2021</h3></a><div>Vaccines are in production and will be available next year </div><div>From <!-- -->Jason Kottke<!-- --> at <!-- -->kottke.org</div><blockquote>With a very effective vaccine ready in Nov/Dec, distributed widely, and if lots of people take it (i.e. the best case scenario), the earliest we could return to “normal life” in the world is the end of 2021.</blockquote><blockquote>Leaving aside what “normal” might mean and who it actually applies to,1 there’s some good news and bad news in there.

It’s the realization that you’re not as happy as you used to be, that you’re not as secure as you used to be, that you’re not as healthy as you used to be. And it all just … happened.

The wildfires are only the latest example of how climate change can cause engineered landscapes to go awry. Those blazes are partly the result of hotter temperatures and drier conditions, scientists say, which have made it easier for vegetation to ignite, causing fires to become bigger and more intense.But the intensity of those fires also reflects decades of policy decisions that altered those forests, according to Robert Bonnie, who oversaw the United States Forest Service under President Barack Obama. And the cost of those decisions is now coming due.In an effort to protect homes and encourage new building, governments for decades focused on suppressing fires that occurred naturally, allowing the buildup of vegetation that would provide fuel for future blazes. Even after the drawbacks of that approach became clear, officials remained reluctant to reduce that vegetation through prescribed burns, wary of upsetting residents with smoke or starting a fire that might burn out of control.That approach made California’s forests more comfortable for the estimated 11 million people who now live in and around them. But it has also made them more susceptible to catastrophic fires. “We’ve sort of built up this fire debt,” Mr. Bonnie said. “People are going to have to tolerate smoke and risk.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/climate/california-climate-disasters.html" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1600447785" alt="Bay Area Employment Still Down by 400K, Labor Force Dropping"/><a href="/links/1600447785"><h3>Bay Area Employment Still Down by 400K, Labor Force Dropping</h3></a><div>Bay Area unemployment down 400k from a year ago

This finding is based on observed changes in the frequency of occurrence of autumn days exceeding the 95th percentile of the historical Fire Weather Index (FWI). The FWI gives a quantitative estimate of the severity of wildfire risk using a multivariate suite of meteorological data (including temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and vegetation “fuel moisture” (which itself incorporates antecedent weather/climate information)). Overall, mean September-November FWI in California increased by about 20% between 1980 and 2018—a trend that was distributed fairly uniformly across the state, including both coastal and interior regions in the north and south. We further found that the occurrence of extreme FWI days was strongly associated with days on which large wildfires occurred—strengthening the link between increasing FWI and the severity of actual fire conditions on the ground.</blockquote><blockquote>Much can also be done to improve the resilience of communities as well as individual structures to wildfire hazards. While the oft-promoted notion of “defensible space” is a good place to start, recent evidence suggests that other interventions are even more effective—including fire-resilient building materials and methods. At larger scales, communities can be designed to better resist fire (by incorporating greenbelts or fuel-reduction corridors, for example). Improved evacuation planning and communications infrastructure can make worst-case scenario firestorms less deadly by making it easier to leave affected areas in a safe and timely manner. And there has also been progress toward reducing high-risk wildfire ignitions during extreme wind events—via “Public Safety Power Shut-Offs” by electrical utilities—although such interventions remain highly disruptive, societally inequitable, and probably unsustainable in the long run due to our warming climate.</blockquote><p><a href="https://weatherwest.com/archives/7550" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1600454839" alt="Lawler: Early Read on Existing Home Sales in August"/><a href="/links/1600454839"><h3>Lawler: Early Read on Existing Home Sales in August</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- -->Calculated Risk<!-- --> at <!-- -->Calculated Risk</div><blockquote>Local realtor/MLS data suggest that the median US existing single-family home sales price last month was up by a steamy 11.6% from last August, partly boosted by the mix of home sales but mainly boosted by the lack of available inventory across much of the country combined with strong demand for SF detached homes.</blockquote><blockquote>Given both the sales and inventory numbers, it’s perhaps not shocking that there has been a rapid acceleration in home prices over the past few months – to the point that one can at least say the single-family housing market has become “frothy,” and perhaps even become a little “bubbly.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/09/lawler-early-read-on-existing-home.html" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1600342035" alt="Home Prices Rose 11% in August—Biggest Gain in Over 6 Years"/><a href="/links/1600342035"><h3>Home Prices Rose 11% in August—Biggest Gain in Over 6 Years</h3></a><div>SF real estate listings up 75%, sales down 13%</div><div>From <!-- -->Tim Ellis<!-- --> at <!-- -->Redfin | Real Estate Tips for Home Buying, Selling &amp; More</div><blockquote>Only two of the 85 largest metros tracked by Redfin posted a year-over-year increase in the count of seasonally-adjusted active listings of homes for sale: San Francisco (+75%) and New York City (+10%).

Something like a tenth of the people who live in the South and the Southwest — from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Southern California — decide to move north in search of a better economy and a more temperate environment. Those who stay behind are disproportionately poor and elderly.</blockquote><blockquote>The millions of people moving north will mostly head to the cities of the Northeast and Northwest, which will see their populations grow by roughly 10%, according to one model. Once-chilly places like Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont will become more temperate, verdant and inviting. Vast regions will prosper; just as Hsiang’s research forecast that Southern counties could see a tenth of their economy dry up, he projects that others as far as North Dakota and Minnesota will enjoy a corresponding expansion. Cities like Detroit; Rochester, New York; Buffalo and Milwaukee will see a renaissance, with their excess capacity in infrastructure, water supplies and highways once again put to good use. One day, it’s possible that a high-speed rail line could race across the Dakotas, through Idaho’s up-and-coming wine country and the country’s new breadbasket along the Canadian border, to the megalopolis of Seattle, which by then has nearly merged with Vancouver to its north.

But you’re alone out there, it’s a lot of intensity, a lot of pressure, and you have to deal with all of that.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/sports/tennis/djokovic-us-open-mental-side.html" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1600143623" alt="Air district calls for 30th consecutive Spare the Air Alert – SFBay"/><a href="/links/1600143623"><h3>Air district calls for 30th consecutive Spare the Air Alert – SFBay</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- --> at <!-- -->SFBay</div><p><a href="https://sfbayca.com/2020/09/14/air-district-calls-for-30th-consecutive-spare-the-air-alert/" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1600124799" alt="Severe wildfire conditions will continue across California, but pattern shift will improve air quality"/><a href="/links/1600124799"><h3>Severe wildfire conditions will continue across California, but pattern shift will improve air quality</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- -->Daniel Swain<!-- --> at <!-- -->Weather West</div><blockquote>Around 3.5 million acres have burned so far in California in 2020. That’s around 3.5% of the entire land area of the state, and is approaching double the previous record for the greatest acreage burned during a single year in the modern record (~1.9 million acres in 2018)</blockquote><blockquote>Then, on top of all of that: the smoke. An extremely large volume of dense, choking smoke has been generated by these numerous extreme large wildfires across California, Oregon, and Washington–leading to “smokestorm” conditions of historic proportions extending all the way from the Mexican to Canadian border (and even farther, at times). Air quality has ranged from “poor” to “extremely hazardous” across California for many consecutive days–making it difficult to even open windows, let alone spend time outside.Even more dramatic, though, was the vertical depth and density of these smoke plumes last week. At one point, multiple fires were generating explosive pyrocumulonimbus (fire thunderstorm) clouds that injected smoke all the way toward the top of the troposphere and even briefly into the stratosphere. The depth of this smoke column–which extended from the surface to nearly 30,000 feet–was sufficient to essentially block out the sun even at midday in some regions, leading to surreal and Bladerunner-esque scenes throughout Northern California. Aside from dramatically altering everyday life, these dense smoke plumes have also radically altered local meteorology–bringing temperatures 10-20 degrees cooler than the ambient airmass would support as solar radiation was largely unable to penetrate the plumes.</blockquote><p><a href="https://weatherwest.com/archives/7532" target="_blank">Read the original post &gt;</a></p></div><div><img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?abstract.1600103714" alt="Scientists Detect Signs of Possible Life on Venus"/><a href="/links/1600103714"><h3>Scientists Detect Signs of Possible Life on Venus</h3></a><div></div><div>From <!-- -->Jason Kottke<!-- --> at <!-- -->kottke.org</div><blockquote>A group of astronomers have announced that they’ve discovered evidence that there may be life in the atmosphere of Venus.
